~~}I didn't think it was possible to find the perfect love that takes up all my life. I waited too long to find out what our true love was. But we got lucky and it became a thing! I can't truly thank you for that, because I never did ask you to. All I can say is that I am lucky to have you in my life. I will truly love you with all my heart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^silly-times~}At times you frustrate me, and at other times you just seem stubborn. I know I was always there for you. I let my emotions fly and my bestiality grow in size. When you needed me, I was there for you. I will never forget how I felt the first time our phones went dead. Just kidding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^mind~}I miss you always. I couldn't even imagine having you in my life if I didn't love you. Just thinking of you makes me happy. Your presence is an angel glow. Every time I look in your eyes, I see a smile and a tear roll down your cheek. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. You make me smile a little bit harder each time I think of you. I do want to say that we have been best friends for a long time. Maybe ever longer, but you know I'm lying. We haven't been dating in a long time. Maybe ever ever ever ever ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}Your voice is like a sweet song I heard for the first time. You take my breath away with you. You make me feel so special, so happy. Your muscles are holding me tight. Your fingers look deep into my soul and touch my shining soul. You make me believe you can make me any good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^worry worry~}Please take care of yourself and don't worry about me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`missing~^mind~}When we decided not to continue our relationship, it was the worst feeling that I had ever had. We both tried to go separately on our own paths, with only an occasional phone call. Mistakes were made and we both agreed that we each made some. Now we are both trying to make it work, hoping that this time it will work, because love and caring seem to be returning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`missing~^~}Thank you for showing me what kind of love all people want me to have, but who I want to marry. Thank you for showing me that true love can be found. Thank you for showing me that my mistake is worth making anyway. Thank you for showing me that kindness!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^~}I know that things could never be the same again, but that's what life is all about--taking risks! I could make you so happy, if you'd just let me try. The things I ask for are things that I can't accept: your personality, his or her ideas, her feelings, just those. All I'll get is a "let's-try" Bundle Package (whatever that's called), and you'll be waiting for me. One day when I get that "thank you" card, I'll give it all to you, and I won't ask for anything more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^thank~}You show your love to me every day. I thank God for us being together every day. It comes naturally. I think about you all the time and think about how much I love you. I'm glad I found you. You mean everything to me. I hope in my prayers that we will only find you like we have found you in the past. I want you, Baby. I love you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^~}I miss you always. I couldn't even imagine having you in my life if I didn't love you. Just thinking of you makes me happy. Your presence is an angel glow. Every time I look in your eyes, I see a smile and a tear roll down your cheek. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. You make me smile a little bit harder each time I think of you. I do want to say that we have been best friends for a long time. Maybe ever ever ever ever ever.<|endoftext|>
