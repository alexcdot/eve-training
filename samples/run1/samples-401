^~}But as soon as I heard you say the words, "I love you," I knew words had to be had. And the answer is both cruel and really, in that you don't express the love you feel in a way that I can understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}Let's make this as simple or over-the-top as the way you want it to be. I love you. Thank you for always being there for me. I look forward to being with you, holding you, kissing/fondling your lips, smelling the scent that belongs to you, hearing your sweet voice, and feeling your smooth back. The only thing that remains is the tension, the emptiness, the emptiness of loving you, I guess, between the love you feel for me and the happiness you feel for me too. This is my attempt to ease those pressures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^~}I miss you. I can't even think about how we really feel about each other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}I think it is a combination of all of these: being happy with just a connection, that is, a connection without words, but with something worthwhile to say. A connection without words is one without the baggage of friendship. A connection without friendship is like finding your way with a friend on the way to dinner. A connection without words is like when we stumble upon each other's limitslessly. A connection without friendship is when we meet each other face to face, eyes seeing what each other are like. A friendly gaze is like when you pull a tear from my eye--or mine--each time you speak, as if there are no other people around. And so on and so forth. Things get really interesting a bit the longer we're together, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^time~}I miss you. I can't even think about how we really feel about each other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^~}I'm sorry for the way I think about you sometimes. I'm so in love with you. The more I think about it, it gets very silly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^your-ex-love~}My love, my beautiful love! I remember the very first time we met was when we were innocently playing that game of Tetris on the beach. We knew that one other than just being friends. We chatted a lot, shared our thoughts and feelings, and were getting to know one another better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^talk~}I've longed for your soft lips and your warm embrace. I've longed for your warm breath and your warm embrace. I've longed for your warm heart and your warm spirit. For the past eight months, I've been longing for those soft, sweet kisses that you so admirablyades. But my longing has never endured, and this moment is no stop. I am yours now, waiting to feel your gentle embrace, then fall asleep right in front of you with my love for you in my soul. You are my soul mate, my soul mate for life. I love you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^~}Hey, Sweetie, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. I should have known better than to make you feel this way. I know you have been disappointed, and I regret and am sorry for my part in some of the mistreatment and neglect that you've been through. I do love you a lot and I'm so glad that we have gotten to where we are. Though some things in life have changesearing qualities to them (like seeing your mom), these are changesome qualities that I have been looking for in my friend for too long. Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, my Sweet, I love you and I am so very sorry that I have let you down. There is no turning back for me, and I am looking forward to the day that we reach 100 years of age and start dating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^your-love love words~}My love, my beautiful love! I remember the very first time we met was when we were innocently playing that game of Tetris on the beach. We knew that one other than just being friends. We chatted a lot, shared our thoughts and feelings, and were getting to know one another better.<|endoftext|>
