startoftext|>~`confession~^the-bottom fall~}I don't know what I would have done this week without your love and support. You make me so happy and I feel so safe with you. Most of all, you make me a happy person. My thoughts flow more freely than ever before. I receive so much joy and comfort with no boundaries. Even when I'm down, you help me to rise again. My heart belongs to you and mine only to you. I appreciate you being there and having your love, which I otherwise could not appreciate, even though I'm apart and in a box. My love for you is already so strong that I can't imagine life without you. I appreciate it when you love me although I don't say it enough, but I can't live without you. It's a heavy burden to carry with me even with my immaturity. I want to understand the nature of love and what makes it worthwhile. I know that most people find love in a stranger or someone they meet through social media. What makes it worthwhile doesn't depend on how good their dream is, or what they imagine a good life would be like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^~}I have spent my life waiting--not living, not loving, just waiting for the one that would inspire me to be all I can be, to live up to all my possibilities, to reach every goal, to know that I may fail sometime, but I will never be alone. You brought to my cold, empty heart a passion only you could bring. Your words of acceptance and love have soothed the aching in my empty heart, and now I am at peace with myself and the world around me. I knew that one day when I found you, my waiting would be over. I love you with every ounce of my being. Yours is the first name I call out in the morning, and the last one I whisper at night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}Thank you for sharing your real estate secrets when you come home from work, then tucking me in at night. Thank you for your love when we hug good night. Thank you for bringing a child to this country to watch his or her motherfuckin' life fall apart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^family love our-lives~}Our lives together began with my pursuit of a man who was mysterious and respectable. I didn't stop until I had Him searching my dreams, Who I would marry, What I dream of when I grow old, What I hoped I would happen to when I die. I've been searching and dealing with a lot of questionsachineers lately, but you've always been there.<|endoftext|>

You know what? I'm so glad I met you and learned so much from you. You know that I love you and that I'm so glad I found someone like you. No matter what, humans are exquisitely capable of making mistakes; they can make completely unnecessary mistakes, or we can spill them over the course of the day or night. We have so much respect for each other and so little self-esteem. Even though we are different, it's still so. That is the only reason I fight this battle. I don't want us to lose it. I want us to win it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^~}I miss you so much and cannot wait until we are together again. I know you are doing everything out of the ordinary for me, but I ask that you understand more about me and my feelings. I am sorry for hurting you so badly.<|endof
