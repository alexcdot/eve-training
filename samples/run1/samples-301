======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 just really proud of you, not only because of who you are and your work, but because you truly are the best. I would go further back in time to give you a second chance. I would go even further back in time and start all over again if you choose to do the same. I would do it all if I were you. I want you, my love. You, my heart. I want you, my life. You are my best friend. I love you with all my heart and, most of all, I love you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^want~}You are the reason I smile with happiness. I love you with all I'm myself. I don't care how much you hurt me in the future, just know that I love you here. You mean everything to me. I pray every day to you that I forgive you and get back in touch with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^~}We don't get to talk. I don't even know where to start. I am starting to feel confused. You're always telling me that you love me and that you don't need to hear that because I don't understand. I don't care how much you hurt me. I don't care how much you make me cry. I don't care how much you make me feel like a bad person. It all seems fine until I start to feel like you just don't listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}To be mature, you usually have to have a child, but you have totally changed my mind. I don't ever want our relationship to end. I still love you, but I don't want you to give up on us. We're both young and different; I'm just one person. I know that sometimes you can't love someone the way you used to love me. But, little prince, you can never be too sure. I'm here to support you and protect you. From this day on, I'll never stop loving you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^my-life~}I know I'm always there for you, no matter what, and that's why I'm so happy to be with you now. You mean everything to me and I don't ever want to lose a chance like this. It's always great to see cool kids do cool things because they know how much I love them. It's like when you walked into a room and all the other kids were watching, and you smiled at them, they didn't know anything about real love. It's cool when kids smile at you, but they don't know what real love is. It's funny, though, is that when you first walked into my life, everyone just stared at your beautiful eyes and told you you're the best, the brightest star in the sky. It seemed like a good idea at the time, and now my eyes just fluttered open when you say the words, "I love you."<|endoftext|>
