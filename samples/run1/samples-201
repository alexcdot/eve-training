 things and how they communicate with each other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^your-mind thoughts~}I have a feeling that when I see you again, it will be like that too. Like the day when I met you. You're my day in the sun, and my night in the glow of your smile. I love you with every part of my being. My heart beats hot because you bring me so much love. No one else can handle it, and neither can I for the love I have for you. I love you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^your-hand~}I've loved and fallen far away from you since the day I met you. For the past three months, I think of each of you and what we could have made together. I can't help but think of your great love, the happiness of our kids, the happy memories of our past romances, the memories of our good times--all of those things are there but are missing from your life. I wish we could have grown together--if only we could have gotten to know each other more. Then, one day, someone would notice and be right for us to fall in love again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`missing~^love the-love~}It's been so long since I've talked to you and felt the love that I felt back then. I don't yet know the feelings you have, but I do know that I need you to love and be with me. There is a part of me that thinks about you all the time now. I am not alone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^kiss~}Thank you for the time you take to kiss me and to talk to me. Thank you, for talking to me all those years and for having me in your arms. I am so grateful for everything that you do. Thank you for making me feel like I'm in your arms and for loving me so much. Thank you for making me feel like a queen. Thanks for making me feel comfortable with you and for smelling like roses. For being so helpful to me and for helping me to find my dream of being your lover. Thank you for loving me so unconditionally. You are a blessing to me and the people around me. Thank you for being mine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}I have a feeling that when I see you again, it will be like that too. Like the day when I met you. You're my day in the sun, and my night in the glow of your smile. I love you with every part of my being. My heart beats hot because you bring me so much love. No one else can handle it, and neither can I for the love I have for you. I love you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^love heart~}I love you so much, but it's too late to be thinking about us anymore. When I think of you, I just want to hold you and hug you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^my-heart~}My heart still burns inside me because you still love me and, when I think back on it all, I still love you with all my heart and soul. You are my true self and you are my dream. No matter what, it is worth it in my eyes because if I keep thinking of you, I can never find you again. I just wish we could go back to those times when we would dance together at night and get spoiled and then get nasty. I know the words you used to say when we weren't together was the song you sang towards me, just so I could finally hear it again and again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}Thank you for the time you take to kiss me and to talk to me. Thank you, for making me feel like I'm in your arms and for loving me so much. Thank you for making me feel comfortable with you and for smelling like roses. For being so helpful to me and for smelling like roses, I am a blessing to me and the people around me. Thank you for being mine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^~}I don't know what I should do anymore. I wish there was some way I could let go and start over. I want to spend the rest of my life with an angelic voice that would love me to give everything to you and make this relationship as long as it lasted. I want to tell you how much
