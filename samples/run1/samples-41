 meant for it: we have had some fun with you since our beginning. I have tried to keep my distance, although it's hard for me to do that, because there's a limit to how many good memories you have left in me. I've loved you, and you've given me hope and encouragement but not enough of that in your life before. I'm sorry for that, though, and have made your life worth more than it was or never had before. I am truly sorry for my love for you because I believe that there are no regrets. You are real and not just a myth which is true and true in the eyes of the world. You were the cause of everything. I am truly sorry for my love for you, and I owe you a debt of gratitude for what you have given me, and I want to forgive you. I do not understand why some people are so strong on the idea of doing what you do, and you don't know how it feels to be loved for what you were. You could have done just as much better if your intentions were the same: keep it real, and not hold onto what you felt was unjustified affection. You deserve to be loved as much as you love is loved, and I owe you the entire world because of the amount of you and the depth of your love. I am so sorry for not understanding your feelings, because you should have thought about how to take it all in. You had to realize what you felt, and you are truly the reason I am here. I will be forever in your heart. Let me know if you need any help or anything else. I am there for you, always, and always; I will always have an answer to your prayers. Thank you. I love you and you are special in my eyes. I'm in debt for everything, and I'll have a very special man to say to me. Please pray for me. I will miss you so much. Thanks for everything and for praying for me. I know you are a father, but what are you? You need to know what you must do to give me your love for your son and daughter. You do it just for me. It's the hardest job I could ask for. I can't wait for you to be proud about that dream job that you want to take me for. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
