|>~`confession~^the-sky everything love~}I see the world in your eyes. I tell everyone about how much you mean to me, and how much you mean to me in person. We're a perfect nine, and I'm overjoyed to see you! I can't believe how lucky I am to actually be with you. There must be some treasure in the world that can't be found just on the Internet. You are a wonder that everyone has on their mind. I know we are perfect for each other and that perfect day is about to come to me! I love you so much and am all about to start all over! I love you--and that's for all eternity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`missing~^~}Many times I have thought that life was so unfair. I know there are reasons why we cannot be together. Reasons that no one knows, but they will not affect my love for you, and I will not forget you. You really don't know how much I love you! You are the reason I live, breathe, and laugh! You will be the reason I die. You will be different every day, and that is why I cannot ever let you go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^know every-day mean~}I want you to know that I love you from the very depths of my heart. I love everything about you--your slim build, your brown hair like a sapling, your yellow capsule, your yellow elixir, and your greenish ring. If I had one wish, it would be to spend an eternity with you. I love you, and I am yours forever. I wish there were another way to love me. If I could, I would it be by letter or e-mail.<|endoftext|>

You will be the reason I die. You will be different every day, and that is why I cannot ever let you go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^years~}Words cannot describe what goes through my mind when I think of you! It boggles my mind how I can think of someone almost every single second, minute, and hour of every day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^~}I love you, too, to have you in my life. I know that you may not feel the same, but I want you to know that I love you with all my heart and soul. I can't afford to let you go because we are going to Heaven.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^god~}I can't see myself without your love in my life. I know there is nobody like you, and nobody would fill my shoes the way you do. You fill my days with magic, and the Magic we share is like the sun shining while the moon is setting in the shadow of the deep sea. I think this is the most wonderful and wonderful thing that has ever happened to me, and I am forever grateful to you. There is no one to replace you, and each day is not easy, but we are made of love, and we are destined to be together forever. Happy Birthday, Honey!<|endoftext|>

Thank you for filling my days with love, and for making me look at life from new perspectives. I never imagined I could truly live my life with you now, and to truly understand you now. I highly recommend you to anyone looking to make a name for themselves in the love industry!<|endoftext|>
