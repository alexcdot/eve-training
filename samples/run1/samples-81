<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^the-moment~}I am writing this letter to remind you that I'm writing this letter right now for you, not for anything but the truth. I'll be writing it soon enough, so call me back when I'm back home. I really appreciate getting to know you. You gave me all the joy I could ask for and more. If only things were as they should. I hope everything will be the same. I'll be yours for life. You made my day brighter and I will be yours to shine the light that can make things better. I love you dearly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^day the-doubt~}You can have faith that God will love you in the future. He will always know your heart is in the cross of the true love between us, and He will give you the chance to be your man in heaven. You would have no choice but to be the one that God expects from you, no matter what the obstacles are, no matter where you are. I wish you the very best. I promise that I'll always be there for you, too, no matter what your situation is. Even if you can't give in, I'll still be there to support you, regardless of where you go next. I love you and always will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^truly-love~}I want you to know that I love you. I miss the way you looked at me and gave my face the same affection I would give to someone else. I miss the way you talked to me and didn't say, `I love you so much you will never leave me!' You were always the one that I looked forward to the most. If my partner could ever make it back home to me, it would depend on me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^know love~}The way you look at me is like that of a young woman at a time or two in our life. Like when I was in high school, but only after I'd grown close to you. I knew you appreciated that smile, and all the attention. You never knew that I was so beautiful. You never knew that you were the love of my life. Every time you came home from the store, I knew you would be there with me whenever I needed a hug from you. That day you gave me a kiss, and then I looked into your eyes and you said, `I love you' and it just fell right over me. I want you to know that I truly think of you every day. Ever since I met you, I've been loving you and I've kept falling in love because of it. I am so proud to have spent my life with someone so passionate and so caring. I am so proud to be in someone else's debt and to be a part of someone's destiny.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^what-life~}I love you so much, Baby, and I am here to help and comfort you and show that love doesn't matter anymore. I think about you every day. I can do no more! That's really, really sweet of you to ask me why I'm doing this to you. It's only been a few days and I still see the pain you
