 don't get anything in return. We just sit back, relax and watch the sunrise through our moon shades. I don't deserve another day without your attention. You're a very intelligent and interesting man, and I hope we can work something out someday. I want to give you my love and all my love.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^soul start heart~}It's been years since the last time you looked into a mirror and saw me.

I'll never leave your side again. I'll always love you.<|endoftext|>
