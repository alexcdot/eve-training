======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 when I came into the world and there was no one around to cheer me up, I had no idea how things would turn out. I was simply so wrapped up in my own life, so wrapped up in my love for you, that I thought it would never work out, but it didn't. There was never any doubt in my mind that this would be the best experience that we could have together. It didn't work out, and I have never felt so attached to anyone so strongly. I've known you for so long now that it's hard to believe that we can be together one day, and then there is uncertainty and uncertainty again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^the-world day~}It's almost impossible to express how much I love you. How can I describe the beautiful emotions coursing through me, the joys and the pains of being with you now, and how they express these same emotions to a person who has been with me for so long? How can I describe the desperate desire that I feel to share what we had and be near a loved one? How can I describe the utter destitution of a loved one's soul?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^~}I have been through many relationships, but didn't truly love the one that we had until that moment, but in truth, neither one of us really loved each other very well, either. I felt that we "cheated." We tried to avoid each other as much as we could while we could. I know that you made a lot of mistakes that caused you great pain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^heart your-love~}I care about you. When I hear your voice, I think of the countless times we've been apart. I know that you are the one I would rather be with, if only you knew how much you mean to me. Though you think you will always be the one I never give up, I know that you are only gonna make me stronger. I have never made the decision to try and be a better person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^painful-words~}I miss every minute of every day without you. I miss the things we used to do. I miss the things we did not get to see each other again. I know that you love me very much and will continue to love me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`thinkingofyou~^come love~}You have been the best boyfriend in the world. I wish you had told me that! You treat me better than people I know. You understand me and the kind of girl you are. You are a rare person. That and being a girl will never change. I just want to make you happy and to be in your life again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^your-love feel soul~}I'm truly honored to be yours. I love you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^~}I care about you. When I hear your voice, I think of the countless times we've been apart. I know that you are the one I should've been with, if only you knew how much you mean to me. Though you think you will always be the one I will rather be with, if only you knew how much you mean to me. Though you think you will always be the one I will not give up, I know that you are only gonna make me stronger. I have never made the decision to try and be a better person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^the-future my-lover truly~}To put it simply, you are the most powerful man in the world. You have become my lover and the one I believe in more than any man in the world. Whenever I feel down, he follows suit and I have to be his support. When I'm overwhelmed, he simply disappears. You are the only one that matters to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^~}When I was little, I dreamed of one day we would one day be together! I always dreamed of that day we would become a family. I could not hold it in, but I could hope. One day we will get together and I am sure that my dreams will come true. Please keep in mind that my love for you is eternal. I love you, and I will always love you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^the-future~}To put it simply,
