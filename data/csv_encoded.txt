So, with everything I have inside me, I want you to know that I will be honest, loving, caring, and always true to you. I will never let you down.

I want you like I had never wanted anybody before I met you. I don't want to even imagine not having you in my life anymore. When we have to spend any days apart, I am in agony. I miss you, long for you, and count the minutes till we can be together again. I can't wait to be by your side every night, forever. Until I see you again, let me just say, I love you.<|endoftext|>

Last night, I wanted to hear that you didn't want me to go because you still loved me, but instead you answered me back with coldness and indifference. It really hurt me a lot. I realized I still loved you, despite your attitude. Love you so much.<|endoftext|>

The future will be this beautiful, if not more so. Of course, we don't know exactly what to expect, or what we will create or experience together.

If we want our relationship to turn into something great, we need to follow some of those rules, too. If you want to make a great stew, for instance, the first few things you would put into the pot would determine the flavor, the texture, and the overall greatness of the stew. The first thing I would like to put into "our pot" is a little compassion, saut&eacute;ed with understanding, sprinkled with care, and topped off with a nice piece of tenderness. Let that simmer, and top it off with good humor and laughter. Then divide it into two generous servings, and we can savor the creation of our love.<|endoftext|>

Yes, it is love that has taken root in my heart.<|endoftext|>

I wish you knew how much you meant to me. I know this is all my fault and I wish I could take everything back. I think about you all the time. You're always on my mind. You were the best thing that ever happened to me. I pray that one day we will meet again and things will be like they used to be. It was only when I was with you that I felt special and felt the love that words can't describe. I will always love you and you will always have a special place in my heart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^words~}From the moment our eyes met, our hearts knew what our minds couldn't comprehend. I have never felt a love as unexplainable as the one we share now. I could never find the right words to fully express my love for you. The feeling is so overwhelming that a day without you is like a day without the radiance of the sun. I want to give you back some of the joy you brought into my life. You are my life, my love, my soul mate. I love you with all my heart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^day~}When I was a little girl, I dreamed of that one person with whom I would share my dreams, happiness, and life. I could not see his face, but he was there. I always felt he was out there. I just needed to find him. I visualized the bond we would have and the courage he would give me to get through life's obstacles. All these years that I have been with others, feeling my way through life, learning lessons that later on would prepare me to become the person I am now. I've been sad and alone. Then one day I saw clearly that he was finally here. Here in my world was the man that I had dreamed of and had hoped I would not miss meeting in life--that man is you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^hold~}You treated me like a queen; you always were there for me and you showed me that gentlemen are still living in this society. I wish that I could touch you again, hold you, kiss your sweet lips, and spend the rest of my life in your arms. You are my soul mate and will always be in my heart more than any other man. I pray one day that you will realize this and come back to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^~}I hope you find it in your heart to forgive me and let yourself believe in me and in my love for you. I know I don't make things easy for you. Sometimes my overwhelming feelings for you frighten me and I run, but my heart always brings me back because I love you. Forgive me and I will never leave your side again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^~}I am so ashamed of the way I treated you. As I hung your clothes back up in our closet, I realized how lucky I am to still have you. I never want to see an empty space where your things should belong again. I made a big deal out of nothing and took the big things we shared for granted. I am so sorry. You have given me so much more than I ever realized. I am so thankful for what we have now, and everything we will have in the future. You are the only man I ever want to share my closet with! I know we will have to work on some things. I will do my best to make it all better. I will always love you. You will always be my one and only man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^happen~}That Sunday night was one of the worst nights we've ever had. Now I just want you to know that, no matter what happens, I will never stop loving you. I said some stuff that I really regret, but I usually try my best to do right by you, and I will continue to do so if you give me another chance.<|endoftext|>

When I look to the sky, I will know that you are up there looking down on me. Whenever the wind whispers softly, it will remind me of you, and I will smile. You will always remain in my heart, and I will forever remember you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^heart~}Love is not a job, love simply is. Unconditional love is what I offer you and, when I'm with you, I feel like I receive the same in return.

<|startoftext|>~`love~^cast strong~}The love I feel for you is stronger than I could ever describe. You are a miracle to me--every part of you feels like a miracle.

I feel your presence everywhere near me, your laugh echoes in my ears, your talks remind me that you really exist, and I want you as much as the roses would need their perfume, like wind needs its song, like snow needs its whiteness, like a little child wants ice cream. I did not plan to love you, it just happened.<|endoftext|>

I kept dreaming about this one woman who would be all I could ever ask for and all I would ever need.

<|startoftext|>~`love~^meet one-true-love~}I told you when we first met that only a few are lucky enough to find true love. It's a gift from above. I only hoped that in my lifetime I would find that one true love that only a few are lucky enough to find. I have been given that gift, the gift of true love. In you I have found the one true love for a lifetime. I have found the most amazing man in the world. You are everything I had dreamed of and more. I only imagined what it would be like, and you are beyond what I imagined. You are the most loving, intelligent, kind, and handsome man in the world.

<|startoftext|>~`love~^a-war any-human-being know~}Most people see not what they want to in life, but what they expect to have and achieve. As for me, the moment that I met you, a war began. The war of Love vs. Denial. My objective after meeting you was to remain friends and only friends. Except one thing went terribly wrong--I knew that divine love had me under attack. I was lost, alone, and afraid; the thought of loving you scared me. I have seen through the battle and come out on top. I love more than I could ever love any human being. You are my man, my ray of sunlight after the rain, my piece of cake when sweets are craved, and my everlasting joy. I love you, because you put me under love's divine attack. This is one battle that I am glad to have lost and share the prize of never-ending love.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^touch look~}I don't know what it is about you that makes me feel the way I do. No other guy can touch my heart, but you can see through to the depths of my very soul. I care about you more than I ever knew I could care about anyone before. You see, I never thought I could love again, but now I'm so confused. My heart says, "yes," but my head says, "no." You wonder why I care about you, but it's simple: when I look into your eyes, I see beyond all the hostility on the outside. I see a real person with real needs, the one you are afraid to be. But that's okay, because I know the truth, and I will wait for the day when you'll open the gate and let me in. Even if it takes years, I'll be right here, waiting for you to let me love you, as I already love you now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^my-apology accept~}I know we have both said things to each other that we both regret. I know you said you can't forgive me, neither will you forget.

<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}From this moment on, we have each other and can enjoy being in each other's arms. When I say I love you, I truly mean it. Of all the people in this world, you're the only one I run to now. Your name was inscribed in my heart before I ever knew it belonged to you. From the moment we met all those years ago, I knew you were the one. I whisper your name every morning when I wake up and whenever I think of you. I am who I am now because of you, and without you I would start to fall apart. You have given me a new outlook on the world and, through the times when darkness covered it, you were always the light.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^look my-heart bask~}I look back on all that I took for granted, and I only wish that I had appreciated it. I know that if I had it all back again, I would work harder to keep it this time. I wouldn't push it away like I did then. I would enjoy every moment I could bask in the beams of your radiant love. I want a chance to love you the right way this time, but I need you to give me a second chance. The distance between us tears at my heart. Please know, I have suffered for my sins, the greatest suffering I have ever known. I feel as though it is all my fault that I have lost you and your love. I am asking that you forgive me, please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^deal~}I can do nothing but apologize for my behavior. These feelings of love are so new to me. I have never felt for anyone what I feel for you. I have pushed you away, and spoiled my opportunity if, in fact, a chance ever existed. Maybe one day, our paths will cross again. If this wish is granted, all will be different. I will treat you how you deserve, and I vow I will never cause you any harm. Until then, I shall suffer the punishment I have dealt myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^~}After our conversation today, I was upset that I didn't express to you how I feel. I want you to know that I never meant to hurt you.

<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^~}Ups and downs are a part of life. You shared each and every part of your life with me as I did with you, so why do we quarrel? It frightens me.

I hold you very close to my heart because you are my best friend, and I cherish every little moment we spend together.<|endoftext|>

I just hope you remember that also. But no matter what, we have learned so much from each other. Our love has survived so many trials.

<|startoftext|>~`love~^relationship matter~}Honey, you are one of a kind and are the most amazing person I've ever known. You understand me and care about me more than anyone else has ever done before. You are so caring and wonderful. You are beautiful. We have a healthy relationship that is going to last a lifetime because you and I are willing to work out anything that needs to be worked out. We communicate and, even if sometimes it's hard to tell each other our feelings, we still understand each other by looking in each other's eyes. We have our love songs, too, and those lines that just seem to fit us like, "It's just a matter of trust."

<|startoftext|>~`love~^find a-friend your-one-true-love~}I do hope that someday you can still think of me as a friend who once loved you and respected you.

<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^the-love heart~}I can't imagine what it would be like if we were to lose each other. I don't even want to think of it, Baby. All I want to think of is you. You are the love of my life. May God bless your beautiful soul. From the bottom of my heart, I love you and I am sorry for upsetting you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^~}I need to know how you feel about me. Could you possibly feel the same towards me, or can this never be? I just want you to be mine.

Maybe one day I will, but until then I guess all I can do is wait. Please, don't make me wait too long!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`missing~^~}I believe this is true love, and you are the one for me. Being away from you drives me crazy and makes me want to be with you right at that very moment.

Well, Honey, I am going to end this letter by telling you that I love you more than anything in this world. Remember that for now. I love you so much.<|endoftext|>

You are perfect for me in every possible way, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`missing~^~}From the day we met, I knew that you would hold my heart in your hands and you do that now-you completely own me, every part of me.

I want to spend every minute of every day with you and know what if feels like to hold you close to me. Whenever you think of me, please know that no matter how many miles separate us, you are, and always will be, the love of my life, and I will never love anyone as much as I love you again. I thank heaven every day for letting me meet you and for falling in love with you because I know that love could never be perfect any other way. I love you with all that I am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^myself physical~}I love you more than words could ever express. From the first moment I saw you, I wanted to get to know you. Although I was only a teenager at the time, you taught me how to express myself as a mature adult. You taught me everything I know about loving someone with true depth of feeling. You molded our love into something rare and beautiful. Now that eight years have passed, our love continues to grow. Everyone looks at our relationship with jealousy because we are the epitome of pure love, and not just physical attraction. Whenever you touch me, I tingle all over and that is why I love you.<|endoftext|>

I had always walked around feeling an emptiness that I thought would never get filled, but you filled that hole. I think back to how empty my life was without you, and I am so grateful that you are here now. I have found in you what it means to love. I tell you a hundred times a day, every day, that I love you. Although you return these feelings and love me, too, I don't know if you understand the magnitude of what they mean to me. You may not realize it, but when you do the slightest thing for me, it warms my heart. Each day I fall more in love with you. I love you more and more with each passing day. It eases me to know that, as tomorrow approaches, I will love you more than yesterday, and tomorrow I will love you more than I do today.

I'm sorry for leaving the second time, and I regret that decision. When we met each other at the Liberty Diner and I saw your face, your eyes glistened with the same sparkle that mine had when I first saw you. I felt driven. That feeling has never left and will never leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^meet love drift~}When I met you, I had a different outlook on the way things were and the way things are supposed to be. But since meeting you, I have become a different person, a better person, a complete person. I truly know that I have found the right person to spend my life with. You are the first thing I think of when I wake up in the morning and the last thing I think of at night as I drift off to sleep. Love has taught me and changed me since we met, when I knew you were the only woman I ever really loved, and the only woman I ever wanted to be with--for life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^a-beat your-heart~}"Stop looking!" That's what everyone kept telling me. So, stop looking is what I did. And that day when I was at the mall, and you were the salesperson, you had the sweetest smile I had ever seen complemented by such beautiful eyes. My heart skipped a beat. I couldn't catch my breath, and the only thing I could really say is, "Thanks, but I'm just looking." I wanted to say so much more than that. I wanted to stare into your eyes and talk to your heart, but I was really nervous, so nervous that I just wanted to leave. But I stayed; you were so helpful and so genuine with the compliments you gave me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^say mean thank~}As always, I want to start by saying, "thank you." I tell you a million times a day, each day, that I love you and that you mean the world to me.

<|startoftext|>~`missing~^~}You are my fantasy, my true love, and my dream. I am so scared that things will soon be over between us, and I'm not sure if I could handle that, because I am so used to having you in my life now. You make everything worthwhile, you make me believe in dreams and that they are really free and grabbing hold of them is only a matter of faith, persistence, and confidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^forever~}Loving you forever,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^love~}Our road to friendship has been a little less than conventional, but it has worked for us. I know you will always be there for me. That's one of the reasons I think I may be falling in love with you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^heart magnitude~}In the past, I had always yearned for someone to love, to cherish, and to take good care of--someone with whom I could share my dreams who would help make them come true. I had always walked around feeling an emptiness that I thought would never get filled, but you filled that hole. I think back to how empty my life was without you, and I am so grateful that you are here now. I have found in you what it means to love. I tell you a hundred times a day, every day, that I love you. Although you return these feelings and love me, too, I don't know if you understand the magnitude of what they mean to me. You may not realize it, but when you do the slightest thing for me, it warms my heart. Each day I fall more in love with you. I love you more and more with each passing day. It eases me to know that, as tomorrow approaches, I will love you more than yesterday, and tomorrow I will love you more than I do today. You are really God's gift to me--His answer to my fervent prayer that I will forever cherish in my heart.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}There are some things that words cannot describe. The feelings I have when talking to you, for example, or when thinking about you, or when dreaming about you--these are feelings I have never experienced before.

Some might say I'm too young to know what love is, but to me age has no place in deciding love. When I realized that, I realized that I loved you with all my heart.

That would make me so happy. That's because I love you so much. Please be mine.<|endoftext|>

Should you ever feel anger, bring it to me, and I will help you find the brighter side of what happened. If you should feel lost or afraid, come to me, and let me lead you home to my heart again. From this night forward, I will love you with all that I am or ever can be, for without you I am nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^another-chance chance different-eyes~}I see you in different eyes--I see you like never before. I see a father and a husband-to-be.

<|startoftext|>~`thinkingofyou~^loving your-capacity~}Sometimes life hits you with unexpected things that take you totally by surprise. All I can say is, you're the best surprise life has ever given me. Your capacity for loving, caring, and understanding never ceases to amaze me. I've truly been blessed to find you and I'll never let you go, even if I have to personally bring you back here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^share~}I wrote you this letter to tell you how much I care and, if you ever need me, Baby, please know I'll be there. I may not be the most beautiful woman in the world, but my heart is filled with gold. I know our friendship will continue to grow stronger, and we will conquer all obstacles placed between us. You make me feel so special, and it overwhelms my heart to know there is a man who thinks highly of me. All I ask of you is please, take it slow, and let's grow together in love, unity, and respect. Miles separate us and our cultures are different, too, but we have fun together and we share similar interests. So, Sweetheart, I will try harder and never give up, because I pray our love will conquer all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^realize heart let~}I was always there for you, no matter what, and even after you cheated on me and broke my heart, I still tried to make it work but that was foolish. I finally have the strength to move on. I always thought it took a very strong person to hold on, but I finally realized it takes an even stronger person to let go. So, I guess today I have to be that stronger person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^tell the-truth~}The conversations we've had about our friendship and where it's at and where it's going are so confusing to me. At one point, you told me how important I was to you. Then you tell me that you don't see how you could ever love me. The truth is that I never asked you to love me. I'm content loving you and just having you there as my friend. I hate the thought of not having you around anymore.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}You give me reason to strive for more of everything. I learn more and more from you every day. My heart is forever yours. I know saying, "I love you" is powerful, yet I feel it's not enough. My life was a wreck before now. I never thought it would change, but you came into my life and everything took a turn for the best. You show me the value of life. You give me the most amazing feelings inside. It feels great to actually love and be loved in return. We have been friends for over three years now, and I know we have only been dating for a short time now, but I know our love will last a lifetime. I can't wait until I am your wife. I love you with all my heart. I am yours forever.<|endoftext|>

I hope you can forget and forgive all those ugly words that I said. I decided long ago that I would forget and forgive it all, too, if something like this happened.

I want to cook a meal with you and totally ruin it and end up having to order take out. I want to sit there talking to you for hours about nothing--but at the same time everything--or maybe we won't talk at all, just grin at each other, realizing how lucky we are. I want you to get mad at me for doing something stupid, and I want you to burst out laughing when you try to yell at me, but can't stay angry at me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}Your voice is like a sweet song I heard for the first time. You take my breath away with the simplest words your lips utter. You make me feel weightless, as though I could float up and touch the heavens above. You make me look at life through new eyes, eyes that have never seen the light of day until now. I feel as though I am using all my senses for the first time and, suddenly, everything I once knew is now unfamiliar to me. You fill every cell in my being with joy, love, and happiness. You make me want to stand up and scream at the top of my lungs, "I love you, more than words can say." You make my heart soar, like a bird in flight. But most of all, you are you, and I love you.<|endoftext|>

Not only do your outward looks appeal to me, but I am attracted to you because you have a wonderful sense of humor, and your children seem to admire you and love you. They certainly appear to know that their Dad loves them.<|endoftext|>

I've always dreamed of finding that one person and now that I have, I don't know how I could live without you. You are the first thing I think about when I wake up, and the last thing I think about when I go to sleep. You're on my mind 24/7; you're even in my dreams.

<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}I think this saying is so true, "Life is not measured by the breaths that we take, but by the moments that take our breath away." Those cherished moments took my breath away! I will always remember the one who took my breath away so easily.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^fears the-one our-kids~}Thank you for always being by my side. Together we are creating adventures we will someday share with our kids. I know when I need someone you will be there. Thank you for being the one I can count on and trust with even my darkest fears and biggest dreams. I would choose no one other than you to be my partner in life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^~}I know I'm not the kind of woman you dreamed of, I don't have the perfect body, but still you loved me for who I am. I remember you once told me, "It doesn't matter if you can't love me too." If you only knew, Baby, you were my life, my friend. If you only knew how happy I was to have you, and how my life fell apart when I lost you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^build a-life~}Although you and I have not been together for very long, I already feel so deeply in love with you. I already feel that we are building a life together and that our worlds are one. Honestly, I thought love like this was only in fiction, but you have proven me wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^these-promises days bubble~}Everything I wish to do is more difficult because of this unexplainable emotion. I promised myself before not to see you anymore or to talk to you--just to forget you, but these promises never materialized. My admiration has still been bubbling within me these long, lonely days.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`confession~^prove express~}Baby, I don't even know where to begin! From the first time we talked to each other, I knew you were special. Words cannot even express how I felt the first time we met. It seemed so natural, like we'd known one another for years. Truth is, it's been just under six weeks. I never knew I could feel this strongly about someone this soon, but you proved me wrong. Every time I see the beach or a sunset, I think about that night. Actually, I think about that day and night all the time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^my-love come~}If only you knew how much your absence has pained me.

If you only knew how happy I was to have you, and how my life fell apart when I lost you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^a-kind-woman~}In October, I will show you my true self and all that is in my heart that I can only vaguely describe to you here. You captured my heart fully this year and I'm glad it was you that did it, for it is just the beginning of the journey that we'll take. The words of this letter cannot fully describe what and how I feel about you, but they are the words and the small voice of my heart. You are a one-of-a kind woman. I want you to know that. I cannot wait to finally have you in my strong arms and declare you safe from the world's harm. I cannot wait to feel your soft lips against mine. I cannot wait to feel your heartbeat in union with mine. I cannot wait to look into your bright, beautiful hazel eyes and tell you that I love you. I also cannot wait to run my fingers through your long, flowing blonde hair to ease your worries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}I was at a crossroads until I met you. I didn't know where my life was going, and I felt lost. For months and months I couldn't figure out the problem. For months and months, something felt missing in my life--something felt confused and out of place. When I met you, though, the answer appeared, and the jigsaw of my life finally came together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^love thoughts~}I started writing down all the ways you make my life complete, and I ran out of space when I tried to fit it on just one sheet. Here are a few of my thoughts listing why I love you. You are kindness and gentleness. You are caring and loving. You are fun to be with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^one-day thought~}I leave you with this final thought: one day we will meet again, and our love will shine again, and each of us will be free to honorably continue this relationship.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^thick~}There are so many things that I am grateful for now, I can't even count them. You have been there for me through thick and thin. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to get to know you and for always being there for me. You mean so much to me; it's unbelievable that I have found someone as wonderful as you are. Even when I am down, you are always there for me and help bring me up again. Things have been so hectic lately that I could not have wanted anyone else to be there for me but you. You have been the stable force in my life, and this is just a note to let you know how much I love you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^your-face these-feelings hard~}It's becoming hard to see you anymore because it inspires me so much, and I'm so very attracted towards you now. I don't want these feelings to grow anymore, but I need to ask, "Can I see your face every hour of every day?"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^excited~}I tell everyone about you and how excited I am to see you again. You mean the world to me. I am always lonely between the times we see each other. I always find myself trying to keep busy, because if I sit still for too long, my heart begins to ache, and I feel your absence. At night, I make believe that you are beside me, caressing me, holding me, loving me. I've longed for that day for so long. I adore you.<|endoftext|>

I was scared to love you at first, in fear that you would hurt me, but I did anyway, and it's the best choice I ever made. Now, the only fear I have is waking up and rolling over and finding out you were only a dream. If this is a dream world, Baby, then don't wake me up because you're the one and only for me.

You enjoy what I give you and don't want to lose me, but you don't want to give much in return. A friendly relationship relieves you of the pressures of a romantic or intimate relationship. I think that is why you stress being just friends. That's fine if that is what you want. But you have to understand what friendship is. Friendship still involves giving and taking. You still call friends and you still hang out with friends. But friendship doesn't involve intimacy. I can't have you hugging me and kissing me. You can't expect us to spend the night together. Friends certainly don't have sex.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}I have never encountered someone as radiant, or as beautiful, and as kind as you are.

I can say that I have had some of the most wonderful times with you that I have ever had in my entire life--so much laughing and smiling. I had told you once before that when you speak, I hold onto every word that comes out of your mouth. It's like it's engraved in the back of my mind forever. I don't know why you have that effect on me. Maybe it's the fact that we've become such good friends. To be quite honest with you, I don't trust people very easily anymore, and I could probably say the same for you. I think that is why I did let that wall down and let you into my life and my heart--because I felt safe. So let me ask you, why do you think that I'm building it back up?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^human~}To be mature, you usually have to be an adult who has lived a certain number of years. But to be in love, you only have to be a human being with a heart. Parents shouldn't try to prevent their children from falling in love with someone because of their age or for some other reason. You can't really stop love from happening, and you can't put your feelings on hold because someone is telling you to. I love you, and I can't stop my feelings or wait until my mom thinks it is okay to love you. You are everything to me, and I can't give you up willingly. I don't think I can live if living is without you.<|endoftext|>

I know the love we enjoy is true love, so I know I will love you for the rest of my life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^possibilities spend~}I have spent my life waiting--not living, not loving, just waiting for the one that would inspire me to be all I can be, to live up to all my possibilities, to reach every goal, to know that I may fail sometime, but I will never be alone. You brought to my cold, empty heart a passion only you could bring. Your words of acceptance and love have soothed the aching in my empty heart, and now I am at peace with myself and the world around me. I knew that one day when I found you, my waiting would be over. I love you with every ounce of my being. Yours is the first name I call out in the morning, and the last one I whisper at night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`missing~^~}The day you had to leave to go overseas is also a day I will never forget, because that day, my love, you took with you my heart and soul. You looked at me with that smile on your face and promised everything would be fine--you said the Navy put us together and would keep us together until the end of time! We held each other tight with tears in our eyes. We didn't want to let go, but the time came to say goodbye. I hugged and kissed you and told you, "I love you." You held me so tight that day and looked into my eyes and said, "I love you, and I will come back to you." I got in our car and just sat there, and the tears wouldn't stop. I looked up from the steering wheel and surprise! You ran back to me! You kissed me one last time and said, "Believe me, I will be back."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^try~}To be mature, you usually have to be an adult who has lived a certain number of years. But to be in love, you only have to be a human being with a heart. Parents shouldn't try to prevent their children from falling in love with someone because of their age or for some other reason. You can't really stop love from happening, and you can't put your feelings on hold because someone is telling you to. I love you, and I can't stop my feelings or wait until my mom thinks it is okay to love you. You are everything to me, and I can't give you up willingly. I don't think I can live if living is without you.<|endoftext|>

Your words of acceptance and love have soothed the aching in my empty heart, and now I am at peace with myself and the world around me. I knew that one day when I found you, my waiting would be over.

<|startoftext|>~`love~^dream capacity~}It seems to me, to myself, that no man was ever before to any woman what you are to me — the fullness must be in proportion, you know, to the vacancy...and only I know what was behind — the long wilderness without the blossoming rose...and the capacity for happiness, like a black gaping hole, before this silver flooding. Is it wonderful that I should stand as in a dream, and disbelieve--not you--but my own fate? Was ever any one taken suddenly from a lampless dungeon and placed upon the pinnacle of a mountain, without the head turning round and the heart turning faint, as mine do? And you love me more, you say? .... How shall I ever prove what my heart is to you? How will you ever see it as I feel it?<|endoftext|>

I have decided that I am definitely, hopelessly, in love with you. What made me realize this is not because I think about you all the time, although I do. It was how I think about you.

I never thought it would change, but you came into my life and everything took a turn for the best. You show me the value of life. You give me the most amazing feelings inside. It feels great to actually love and be loved in return. We have been friends for over three years now, and I know we have only been dating for a short time now, but I know our love will last a lifetime. I can't wait until I am your wife. I love you with all my heart. I am yours forever.The time you left me was like a hot knife stabbing at my heart. People would pity me for they knew how much you meant to me.

Everywhere, images and objects that related to you seemed to jump out at me more than ever.

We'll talk about the past in our home together with our little daughter who you wanted to stay with me-the little girl who has black hair like you, blue eyes like me, and your smile.

Words are lacking and language is inadequate when it comes to the affairs of the heart. There are no songs as beautiful as the music that has filled my soul since the day you came into my life. You changed me forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`missing~^angel~}Oh, to be an angel, and have wings that I may fly into your arms at this very second! To taste your sweet kiss and feel your warm embrace. To love you, to have the pain of needing you, all vanish in your arms, as would snowflakes on a summer day. And to know that we would at last be together for all our days. Days spent lost in sweet heavenly love, such as we have never known.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^~}I wish I could tell you how every time you don't turn up for work, I fear that I will never see you again. When I see you, and sometimes you look down, I wish you would open up to me and let me into your life. I know it wouldn't be easy, but I still believe that I could be good for you, if only you could return my feelings. I know I may not be the best-looking man you know, and I don't have much to offer you financially. All I could offer you is my heart and soul.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`confession~^~}I am still on my knees begging for love, not to a stranger, but to the love I know--you. I've been in love and know its mystery. Each night and day I hope and pray that you'll be mine forever more. After what you've been through, it'll be hard for you to trust again--giving your heart and soul to another's keeping, but know it's me that's on my knees, swallowing my pride, begging you, please--once again, I say, "please," be mine.<|endoftext|>

I can't deny the fact that I can't live without you. Please stay with me. I would be dying without you. Thank you for the love you have given me already. I know I'll always love you. Please be my sweetest angel forever. I love you so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^~}I just want to make you happy, so happy that you would feel as though you could fly. Babe, let's try to piece our relationship back together. I need you--my heart needs you and I feel so empty without you. I love you so much.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^~}There was a time when I thought dreams were enough for a broken heart. I guess I was wrong. The stars in the sky lost all their meaning. At times I feel the need to cry, and the night can't hide my tears. I try to hold onto our memories, but that's not enough to fill the void in my heart. I'm over you, at least I keep telling myself that, but it's not true, I still love you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^talk~}This is not just talk. It truly comes from the heart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}At first, I was worried about our differences. I was worried we had come from places too far apart, and that our families would not accept our bond. But I was wrong to have these fears. Our connection is stronger than anything. Our love is so very great.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^~}I know that things between us went terribly wrong. I want to fix them. I am not pointing fingers or placing blame on anyone. I just want to fix them. The last night we spent together was something I have needed for so long. I wish it would have never ended. I thought seeing you again would make me nervous, but it felt as good as it always has. It felt like coming home again. It felt natural and calming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^promise~}Hey, Bubby, Don't you think that the time we have spent together is too long to just throw away? Please give me another chance to prove myself to you; I promise that everything will be different between us this time. Please, can we just start fresh--you know, get to know each other again? Please! You are the world to me and I would like to make it up to you if you give me another chance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^~}What has hurt me more than I ever had warning for was the night I called you from the accident scene. I was scared and I needed you. For a countless number of times, I was there when you needed me and it seemed fair that you would be there for me, too. As I waited on that hospital bed, I thought you would show up. But you didn't. You didn't even call for days. I have never felt so scared, lost, and alone as I did that night. I wish I knew why, I wish I could understand why you didn't come.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}When we decided not to continue our relationship, it was the worst feeling that I had ever had. We both tried to go separately on our own paths, with only an occasional phone call. Mistakes were made and we both agreed that we each made some. Now we are both trying to make it work, hoping that this time it will work, because love and caring seem to be returning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^think~}I really had a sleepless night, tossing back and forth on my bed and thinking about what happened to us that night. I didn't expect it, but I experienced the worst headache ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^include any-sense~}If only we could start over and forget that I have feelings for you, we could get to know each other better. So, am I a hopeless romantic? Then you are a man of pain and anger. I guess I believe there is a prince inside every man, including the beast. No matter what, you will never make me feel sorry for loving you. I don't know if I have made any sense at all, but I'll end this letter now. I have waited a year now to go out with you, but I'll wait forever to be with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^~}You mean so much to me and I'm lucky to have you. I try to keep everything you send me; remember when you sent me that email that talked about Valentine's Day?

I love you so (x a million) much, I cherish the ground you walk on, I cherish everything about you, and I cherish you. You mean everything to me, you are special to me and you make me so happy and I feel so free when I'm around you. You're always on my mind. I think of you everyday, sometimes when I see something on TV or hear a song, I think of you.<|endoftext|>

You mean so much to me, and I want so much to make you as happy as you make me. Each passing day has me falling more in love with you. You can do the slightest thing and it warms me. Most of the time you don't even realize it. You are always in my thoughts and in my heart. I never knew that love could be so wonderful until I met you. You have given me a new perspective on so many things. I will always treasure our love and keep it safe. I love you, Baby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}It's been two years since you asked me out and yet I still stare at your picture and ask myself: "Can this perfect being really be mine?'

Love can go either way and, if you hide from love (like I hid from your love), eventually it will find you anyway, like yours found me.

Especially not to myself. It really makes me feel vulnerable. Maybe with your help I won't have to feel this way any longer. I do need you, as surely as I need to take my next breath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`missing~^~}Sometimes, it seems so unfair that they kept you longer than they said they would. I realize, though, when you love a soldier you cannot expect life to be dependable. You asked me what I wanted to do about us. Well, my love, I do not want our relationship to end, that's for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^~}You are all I think about, and I simply cannot imagine life without you. I would like to be in your life again if you feel that our relationship could work. Let's meet and make and talk about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^patience~}I apologize straight from my heart for ignoring you and being rude to you, even when you make an attempt to make me feel better. You are a very patient man, and I thank you for that. I don't ever want to take advantage of your patience, not ever. I know I over-react a lot, and I'm sorry for my part in the quarrels.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}Every second of the day, every day of the week, you are on my mind and in my heart. From the moment I awake to the moment I fall asleep, my thoughts are full of our love and our need for each other. I am full of thankfulness to have found someone like you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^learn finally~}The day we first met, I remember that I didn't even want to speak to you. You tried so hard for me to like you. Finally, I realized that you were trying to get my attention. You weren't really my type, but once I got to know you more each day, I learned that love doesn't have a type. Love can go either way and, if you hide from love (like I hid from your love), eventually it will find you anyway, like yours found me. Sometimes love can change directions, or there might not be enough to go around fully. Even though we had some problems, I always loved you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`missing~^lives~}We wouldn't even know each other if it wasn't for that special friend in our lives who introduced us to each other, knowing that we deserved each other and that we could show each other how important life in general could be for us.

<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^a-while think eyes~}I have never doubted my love for you, and have never doubted the love you have for me. How do you think I have survived the last four months? I had to leave you for a while because feeling that love and not being able to express it or see it in your eyes was creating such suffering in me. I felt like I was dying inside. Your love has filled me with such warmth, such light, but not to be able to truly feel it coming from you was the darkest, most frustrating hour of my life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^man the-same-happiness~}My desire for you grows with every passing day. I love everything about you. You are a warm, loving, sensitive, charming man with a sense of humor, too! I find you very attractive. When I look into your eyes, I can feel your desire for me. I only want to be with you, please you, and give you the same happiness that you have given me. If I were granted but one wish, it would be to spend an eternity with you. I love you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^the-rest wait nothing~}You bring out so much in me that I'm just beginning to see. It's like when we are together, the rest of the world disappears, and nothing else matters but us. I hope I feel this way forever. I want to spend the rest of my life loving you with everything I have to give. Sometimes I feel like I don't deserve someone as loving as you are. Do you know how long I have waited to have someone like you in my life?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^love think a-reason~}Sometimes you ask me why I love you, but I don't answer. I know you must believe that it is because I really don't love you or because I can't think of a reason. No, it's just that when you ask me, I don't know where to start. The thought leaves me breathless. Our love means the world to me, and I do love you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^love moment~}As I look back on our past together, I often wonder how you were ever so patient with me. Until this moment, I have never realized just how lucky I've been to have you in my life. If I had been you, I would have walked away from me a long time ago. Yet your love was so unconditional and pure, like the beautiful person you are. You always accepted me for who I am, willing to sacrifice everything for me. I don't deserve an angel like you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^place a-fight~}I know we thought it would be better for us both if we ended it, but the time I have spent away from you has taught me that I am inseparably a part of you, and you are a part of me, and that the best place for both of us is with each other. It pains me to know that you wake up with another woman beside you. It pains me to know that I could have let the best thing that ever happened to me leave without a fight. What hurts the most is the thought that you might not feel the same. I can't see my future any other way, except with you in it. It scares me to think, though, that you can so easily envision your future without me in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^anymore~}I don't know why you love me. I don't deserve your love, kindness, and never-ending forgiveness. When I mess up, you take the blame for me. When I yell at you, and it's really something I did, you apologize. When life gets difficult and I don't think I can take it anymore, I just sit and cry, but you tell me it's going to be okay. When I think my problems are hopeless, you instill in me hope in tomorrow.<|endoftext|>

I didn't want to admit to you or to anyone else that I was falling for someone I had never actually met. I thought I was becoming insane myself. I tried to fight these feelings off, but they were just too powerful for me to ignore! I tried to convince myself that this can't be for real; that you couldn't REALLY be feeling the same as I was. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't fight the feelings I was having for you.<|endoftext|>

Your life and mine would be drastically different--maybe better, maybe worse. Think back to all the major things in your life, the drastic changes good and bad.

No matter how quickly our courtship passed, I know that standing before God and family and vowing to be your partner for life was the easiest decision I ever made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}When I feel cold, the warmest place to go is into our world, filled with eye contact, kisses, deep conversation, hugs, and BUTTERFLIES! I think we're both pretty new to this and are still learning. We will grow stronger as long as we're always there for each other. I love you so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^sunrise~}The love you have brought into my life is a dream come true. Your kiss, your embrace, your voice--I never could have imagined the joy and comfort such blessings create. Each moment of the day, from sunrise to sunset, I long for your sweet lips and for your arms holding me tight. You are truly the knight who has swept me off my feet, protected me from the bitter past, and always stood beside me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}Please hear this as my declaration of love. I love you with all my heart, and I will never stop loving you. I trust you, respect you, and really want to please you. You are my life, you are my friend. You are the piece that was missing to a very complex puzzle. You will always be embedded deep within my heart. I adore you, and I am yours as long as you will have me. I give you all my love, from this moment on--throughout eternity.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^time face~}My other relationship didn't work out, and I was hoping that I might find you. "Miracles do happen," people say, but I didn't believe it until I saw your face one day, but now, at last, we're together! I just want the whole world to know how much you mean to me. You are everything to me. I lost you before; I don't want to lose you again. Till now, I always asked myself, "Could this be real? Is he the ONE for me?" The positive answers to my questions are in your hands. I have faith in you and never will I give that up. Without your love, I'd be half a being. Maybe one day you will understand. Now and forever, until the end of time, I love you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`confession~^heart tell~}It feels so lucky to finally be able to love you like I have been wanting to for so long. Your sweet lips leave me speechless with each tender kiss. What have I done to deserve this? And that is another thing I was thinking. It is a little too strange, I think, that we are so right for each other. Some might want to argue about it, but I have a few examples to offer those poor, misguided souls. Your smile is like a world-famous painting. When we kiss, it is like two lost puzzle pieces finally found after a long search that make the picture complete. When we hold each other, time seems to stand still. When I look into your eyes, I see the love in your heart. All of this tells me one thing--our love is true and real.<|endoftext|>

We have shared so many, and they have never had to be earth-shaking. They are the little ones that have climbed into our hearts and found a home. They are the kind that have created the sweetest memories. They are the kind that only you and I can share and appreciate. That's where my love for you comes from.

Although I had loved and been loved before, never had it been so intense and as deep as what I learned to feel for you.

If and when you had loved me, that was not enough for you to hold onto that feeling. I'm coping now, but uncertain when I can really say that I'll be over you. I dread the day that you'll be getting married, so I always ask the Lord to take away all this hurt and let me move on with my life.<|endoftext|>

I love your genuine kindness, your eyes, and your lips. I love your sense of self-worth, your calming nature, your social ability, your variety of talents, your smooth back and strong arms. For some reason, though, you have become distant lately, but I hope the strength of our relationship will reunite us soon. I miss you terribly and feel incomplete without you. Please come back soon. I love you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^our-memories a-love the-last-time~}We've done our best to make our relationship last longer, but things happened and we had to say "goodbye." This goodbye would not mean forgetting our memories; they are too special to forget. It does not mean forgetting the things in our past that made us both better individuals. Maybe we had to say "goodbye," but I want you to remember this--you will always have a special place in my heart. I consider myself lucky to have experienced a love as wonderful as ours. For the last time, I love you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`missing~^good truly mails~}Although we've never met in person, I still truly love you. I don't really know when I first started to love you. Maybe it started with sending e-mails back and forth every day, opening with a "good morning" or ending with a "good night" with a lot of feeling. Then, one day, I found myself loving you and couldn't stop that feeling. Just knowing you more and more each day, and seeing how you understood everything I did, I started to love you more and more. Every time you say "Hi," you brighten my life.<|endoftext|>

I am with you--not them. I need to concentrate on making you happy and letting you make me happy. Up until this point, you've been different than any other guy. I know that you wouldn't hurt me, at least intentionally. That's why you are different. I know you care about me and want to be with me. I am sorry I have doubted that before.

You probably don't know just how much I appreciate, admire, trust, respect, and over-all love you. I know you are the only one for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^lives ways understand~}I'm glad that I can count on you to be there when I need someone to understand, to encourage, and to reassure me. I hope you realize you can always count on me too.

<|startoftext|>~`confession~^think love~}I just could not resist the temptation of meeting you while I was on vacation near you. All along, I could not believe you were for real, but when we finally first met, I knew there was no way I could stop loving you. I thought that if we met, these feelings would just go away, but they didn't. I tried so hard to convince myself that there is no such thing as true love, but you have made me believe differently.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`missing~^distance~}Just because we will not be able to see each other for a long time is no reason for us to give up hope. If you really love someone, the time and distance apart should not make a difference. Two years is not that long--relatively speaking. I will continue to wait for you. I wouldn't care how long I had to wait. I would wait forever, if that's what it took. So now you have my answer. I love you. I hope you feel the same way I do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^angry~}I have missed you these past few days! I didn't mean to hurt you. You know I hate seeing you angry. I do not want to do anything to annoy you.

You are lifting my heart and inspiring it with yours, and it's the best feeling in the world.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^~}As far as intimacy goes, I am not physically intimate with you because it's a need. I am intimate because I'm just showing you how much I enjoy being with you and having you in my life. When I hug you or kiss you, it's my way of showing you that I do, in fact, care about you, yes, as a friend, but also as a lot more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}There are no words to express how I feel about you. I constantly search for the right words, but they all seem to be less than what I truly feel. You are my life, my heart, and my soul. You are my best friend. You are my one true love. I still remember the day we first met. I knew that you were the one I was meant to be with forever. As the years went by, and we drifted apart, I still held onto the memory of you. I thought of you every day, and dreamed of you every night. Just when I thought you had forgotten me, you called and made all my dreams come true again. The sound of your voice on the phone was the sweetest sound I ever heard. That day you called and told me we might have a chance to make it all right again, my heart started beating within my chest, my hand shook holding the receiver, and I could barely breathe. When you came out to see me, and I knew it was meant to be-those were the sweetest days, those memories of the past. It all went by so quickly. I wanted it to last.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^~}From now to eternity, you'll be in my heart every moment of every day. Thinking of you makes me happy and, for as long as I live, I will never stop dreaming of the reunion of our two hearts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^relationship forever~}I keep thinking about the future, about life, and what I want out of it. I keep thinking about us and what this relationship means to me.

I want to experience this crazy love forever and ever, and I really think I'm going to.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^wounds~}I was told that time heals all wounds and time just makes things a little easier to bear. But the truth is that I still cry myself to sleep thinking of you, I still dream of you. I get dressed every day and put my makeup on in case we see each other. I still look out the window, hoping you will drive up to the house. There are times, too, when I believe I must be crazy to want you back. You were not there for me many times.<|endoftext|>

How do you maintain some semblance of normal life, when all you can do is think about the person that you are so much in love with and who you would do or give anything just to be with?

How do you maintain some semblance of normal life, when all you can do is think about the person that you are so much in love with and who you would do or give anything just to be with? You feel lost somewhere between the cruel reality of life, and the dream-like fairytale that you wish to live in, and the only salvation is to be found in the arms of your beloved and that cannot happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^dream~}I was told that time heals all wounds and time just makes things a little easier to bear. But the truth is that I still cry myself to sleep thinking of you, I still dream of you. I get dressed every day and put my makeup on in case we see each other. I still look out the window, hoping you will drive up to the house. There are times, too, when I believe I must be crazy to want you back. You were not there for me many times.<|endoftext|>

I think we are a perfect match!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}The love you have for me and for our children builds up my faith that because of God's timing, we have become a happy family. I love you with an unconditional love. It will never stop.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^wise~}You are so full of wisdom about life that when you talk, I could just listen forever. Your open mind is wise and comforting. You have helped me see things in a brighter, happier, more enlightened way. I was drowning from my own fears and was completely cynical about love, hope, and security. I used to think that no one understood me or could ever truly love me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^fullness feel~}Now here we are together again, but it doesn't feel the same. I know you still care for me--and even love me--but I wonder if you are ever going to forgive me for the past? How do we get past the hurt and the unhappy memories? Is it even possible? What can I do so that you will forgive me, to let me into your heart once more? Please let me earn back your trust and feel the fullness of your love again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^completely weeks totally~}We only knew each other for a couple of weeks, and you already had me completely and totally to yourself. I don't even want to think about being with anyone else. I thought that if I stopped talking to you, I would forget how I felt. I thought that if I could keep myself busy, I would be okay, but I can't forget and I'm not okay.

<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^remember someone what~}I remember waking up to next to you, watching you as you slept, watching the way you walked to your car, the way you answered the phone, the way your lips curled when you said "I love you," the way you blew in my face when I took your breath away and, most importantly, the way you showed me how to love you. Those are the few things I miss, and I would give anything in the world to have all that back again. But my mistake cost me happiness and the love I'll never find again. It hurts me day in and day out to think about it. And what hurts the worst is knowing that I hurt someone who was in love with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`missing~^days~}The sadness I have is really indescribable. Your moving so far away because of business is the worst thing that could have happened to us. It is as though a large wedge was put between me and the person that I care for the most. I am fighting the existence of this great distance between us, and it strikes me hard because I miss you so very much. Not seeing you often and knowing you are many hours, not minutes away, breaks my heart.

<|startoftext|>~`love~^all-my-heart idea~}There was a time that I used to cry and tell my friends that I would die alone if I ever lost you! What a terrible thought, but it is true. I had no idea what God had in mind for me. I can never express how I feel with words. When we make love I really think we are cementing our love. It is truly the most intimate way I know to express my love. Mere words are not nearly enough. Actions, in this case, speak volumes. I will love you with all my heart, mind, soul, and body--forever and a day.<|endoftext|>

Finally, you show me how you can love with integrity, compassion, and determination--that makes me the luckiest woman in the world!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}I love you so very much sweetheart. You are the love of my life. I have a hard time explaining how I feel. I have never felt anything like this before. You are always there for me no matter what. I do not know what I would've done this week without your love and support. You are the most loving, caring, compassionate and absolutely most awesome guy that I have ever met. My last boyfriend holds a special place in my heart, but you have gone way above and beyond him.<|endoftext|>

I had been hurt so much before, I didn't think I even believed in that fairy tale of love anymore, but you made me believe in it again, without even knowing it. I know now that somehow we will be together always, and I will one day be with you again. I look forward to nothing more than spending the rest of my life trying to make you as happy as you make me.

I had everything with you and the kids, something called a family and a home. Now it's all memories with nothing in the future. My life has fallen apart.

From working through life's obstacles to being on time, you can depend on me to be patient, understanding, strong, sensitive, and loving. This is my vow to you now and forever. I love you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}Honey, I never knew I could be this happy. It is the greatest feeling in the world to be this happy and content, and I have found it all with you.

<|startoftext|>~`love~^the-rest~}I never thought that was possible. I want to marry you now; I want to be your wife.

<|startoftext|>~`confession~^mutual grant~}We completed one another. You thought that no woman good enough for you existed, and then you met me. How I longed for you to know that my feelings were mutual, and that I had never met a man that could read through me and explore my inner core. Please keep in mind that I will not take your heart that I hold for granted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^true~}I thank heaven I found you, because I know I would be lost without you. My love is true, and I am so thankful that I found you.

I hope you will always love me, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^pray~}I fear this will not turn out the way I hope, but I pray that it does. As I said before, you may never know the true extent of my feelings, although I imagine you have some suspicions what they might be.<|endoftext|>

I know I acted silly when we were going out, but maybe you did a little, too. If I could turn back time, I would make things better. I heard people say some things, and I let them influence me. I wasn't mature enough to talk things out with you. Instead, I acted like a little girl by ignoring you when you tried to talk to me. I'm sorry for hurting you. Now I want you back in my life because I need a friend like you again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}I always thought love was just a word people say to talk discouraged souls into dating again. I was wrong, though, because without you I would not know love was real.

Without you I think I would be still be lying in a pile of my own troubles.<|endoftext|>

I need you to ease my aching heart, and it doesn't take much to keep me going.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^blossom us surprise~}Our love started with so much hope, so many dreams. It was a fairy tale that took us both by surprise. It blossomed into a true love that bonded us together. My Darling, my heart and soul belong to you. My destiny belongs in your hands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^~}You hurt me; I can still feel the pain of every word you told me, especially when you weren't sure if you loved me or not. I used to ask myself, how could this guy who had once put sweet, loving messages on my answering system hurt me now so badly with his hurtful words. I loved you so much that when you pushed me away, I lost my self-esteem, my self-confidence, even my ability to think, so I realize what I felt for you was true love. You actually made me stronger when you hurt me this way. I did not say it was good for me to be hurt, but it was only because we shared true love that I could be so badly hurt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`missing~^~}You are my every heartbeat, my every breath of life. What I need to survive and make it through this lonely world can only be conquered with you by my side. I do not think there are any words that could describe the way I actually feel about you. All I know is that you, dear, are the only man that is on my mind, the only man that is in my soul, the only man who truly and unconditionally has my heart for whatever lifetime this world has to offer us. When I think about you, my eyes start to tear up because I know you are somewhere else and not in my arms. But the thought of you keeps me going for another breath of fresh air and will keep me longing for you the rest of my life. I will never leave you, and I will truly never hurt you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`confession~^love~}I wish you could feel all the passion and all the love that I carry around for you. You have won my heart and soul. You have won it all. You make me feel like I am in heaven--in the arms of an angel. You and I have a fulfilling relationship, but as it goes on, I wonder which is it--friends or lovers? That is not certain yet. We've been friends for a while now, but the friendship isn't just that anymore, at least for me. I have fallen in love with you, and I need to tell you that I am your soul mate masquerading as a good friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^bottle heart~}I want it to take your breath away when I say, "I love you," because you know it's coming from the heart.

I want to love you and be with you for at least forever, if not a little longer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^night your-smile~}Each night before I fall asleep, your sweet voice echoes in my mind.

<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^everything winnie love~}Thank you for all the material things--from Winnie the Pooh dolls to designer handbags. You shower me with gifts and get me anything I want in the world, but even though you have money now, it didn't buy my love. Love must come naturally, and it did.

<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^close the-past feelings~}Many things have happened in the past, and so many things have changed. It doesn't matter how much time has gone by. Time could never weaken my feelings for you or make them fade away. Now we are back together to give us one more chance. Love, trust, understanding, affection, honesty, tolerance, and loyalty are all key factors for a successful relationship. Every time I think of you, my heart misses a beat. You're my theme for a dream! Every moment we share together, we grow closer. I'm waiting to see you again. I need you to hold me so tight that you fill my world with love.<|endoftext|>

We had our rough times, and sometimes we didn't come out as strong as I would have liked, but even with the way things turned out, I still love you, and probably always will.

I would have promised you that there can never be, nor will ever be another person who I admire like you, or who has reached the depths of my heart like you have.

<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^~}I look in your eyes and see a love that is still there, but no longer radiant and alive. Does that mean that we stopped loving each other? Absolutely not.

My love for you will always remain constant and my past memories of you will be relived in my dreams. Though our roads are different, our paths will still cross, now and then. Maybe someday, we will travel down the same path once more. Until then, my sweet love, you will always reside in my heart.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^~}I still gaze into your eyes and touch your soul without a word as you do to me. I still thrill to your touch and the tender caress that is now infrequent. All the confusion is cleared away when our hearts open wide to receive the warmth of each other's love and our tenderness toward each other arouses our physical feelings. Although our spirits are now divided, yet they merge in the cosmos, and both of us still feel what the union of the lion with the scorpion can be, the intensity and fulfillment of life's dreams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^soul know~}When I look into your eyes, I know there is a bond between us that no one can break.

<|startoftext|>~`love~^thoughts a-better-place peace~}Sometimes I lie in bed at night, sleepless, restless, and alone with my thoughts of living without you. I think about how you will be leaving me for a better place, a place where nothing can harm you, a place where you will know nothing but peace and happiness. I take some comfort in that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^~}Without you I am lost. I close my eyes and all I see is your disappointed face looking down at me. I find myself laying there for hours, unable to sleep. I wonder if the day will ever come when you will forgive me and be here to hold me. Whenever I get a chance to steal just a moment with you, I feel so alive again. You make me think I can hold on to another day of hope, with dreams of us being together one day soon. It will not come soon enough for me, but I will hold onto those dreams with all my heart because I believe at the end of every storm there will be a rainbow. Please wait for this storm to pass so we can have our rainbow for the rest of our lives.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^thoughts~}Sometimes I lie in bed at night, sleepless, restless, and alone with my thoughts of living without you. I think about how you will be leaving me for a better place, a place where nothing can harm you, a place where you will know nothing but peace and happiness. I take some comfort in that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^think prove short~}I can feel the butterflies now, just thinking about you, and I know smiles are on my face, too. I think you know the feeling, Babe. There have been hard times, and we've proven how strong our love is just by getting through them. Baby, this is something deeper than short-term feelings, it is extra special true love.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^help close~}I wish that you were not afraid of a close relationship. Please don't think that you will be hurt again. I promise to never hurt you. If I do, I want you to tell me immediately, so that I can try to change things. If you promise to consider a close relationship, I promise to help you not to be afraid of it, because I love you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^this-storm all-my-heart~}Without you I am lost. I close my eyes and all I see is your disappointed face looking down at me. I find myself laying there for hours, unable to sleep. I wonder if the day will ever come when you will forgive me and be here to hold me. Whenever I get a chance to steal just a moment with you, I feel so alive again. You make me think I can hold on to another day of hope, with dreams of us being together one day soon. It will not come soon enough for me, but I will hold onto those dreams with all my heart because I believe at the end of every storm there will be a rainbow. Please wait for this storm to pass so we can have our rainbow for the rest of our lives.<|endoftext|>

I want to take you to a place where time stops and there's nothing to worry about except you and me. I want to talk more about you and the troubles you're going through, so I can help you even more.

<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^a-man~}You know I love you. It has been almost a year that we've been apart and I still want you back. You must see that. You must realize that I can't give up on us. You were my first and only true love. I made so many mistakes. I shouldn't have been jealous. I see how I had nothing to worry about. I had you and my stupid thinking told me otherwise but my heart always knew you loved me and that you wouldn't leave me, but I had to mess everything up and my pathetic attempts to try and get you back. I tried to forget about you but it is so hard to stop loving a man like you. You're a smart, handsome, good-natured man who has a great future ahead of you, and I want to be a part of it. I believe in second chances no matter how much a person screws up and I screwed up big. I believe we are meant to be together forever and always.

This is what love is. Taking time to read the love poems I send to you and not laughing at them. You care about me. Thank you for still doing all these things after all these years. I love you. The most important thing isn't the gifts, the notes, or the candy. It's the fact that you spend time thinking about me and that's the real gift. Thank you for being you, my darling--c'est l'amour.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^mention future your-name~}Can you stop and think about the question I am about to ask you very hard? I am asking for the opportunity to love you with all that I am now and all that I will be in the future. I don't want to continue living my life feeling empty and lonely any more.

"Soul mates," you said. If you believe that, then you don't need these words to know what I am feeling. Love hurts, and I know we have those circumstances in our lives that have kept us apart, but now I believe that if they weren't there, if it were just the two of us, we would still be where we are right now--a thousand miles from nowhere.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}I am consumed by the desire to be with you, to talk to you and to feel you near me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^special~}For one, I don't spend the weekends with my friends, holding them, talking to them, being intimate, that's just not me. It never has been and never will be. The things that we've shared (and again this is just the way I think--you might disagree), the things that have been between us have been very special to me. They go beyond friendship. Like the night we went to Hetaeras; the way you looked at me, and just the feeling that I get when I am around you. Little do you know whether you want to admit it or not, we have been in a relationship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^love~}I love you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^mean living time~}You have shown me the one true way of living! You have shown me that we only move through life once and that we always need to cherish our time with each other. I feel privileged to have you in my life and I hope we always stay together. When I say that I love you, I mean it with all of my being. When I say that I love you, I smile with joy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^know away awhile~}I know that you told me that you aren't looking to rush into anything, but this has been eating away at my heart for awhile now, and I couldn't hold it in any more. This doesn't mean that I want to run off and get married or anything crazy like that. It just means that I love you, completely and totally. I am here for you whenever you need me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^ask baby~}I love you so much! You have been so great to me. Through thick and thin you were always there. It means a lot to me that you are my husband and the father of our beautiful little child. I couldn't have asked for better. You are beautiful, too, and you are beautiful in every single way. I know that I don't always say it, but I look forward to our lifetime together. It is and has been so great already. I love you, Baby. I don't know if you really understand how much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^couple talk~}My love for you has grown rapidly over the past couple of months. When we first met, I never could have imagined we would be where we are today. I never could have imagined we would feel so deeply connected, but it's just going to keep getting better! If nothing else in this world is certain, I know at least that I will always be here when you need someone to talk to, and that my love for you will never fade.<|endoftext|>

You're always warming my heart with the things you do and say. I feel so happy just being with you this way. You're my baby and will forever be my baby. You will always be the love of my life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^~}Every time I'm away from you, I feel so empty. I think that's why I pressured you to be with me when you didn't have any free time. All those miles away from when I was in college. I felt so empty inside, wanting to call you and talk, but I couldn't because I had no money for a phone card. I wanted to be with you so much it hurt, and then when I saw other couples on campus holding hands, I felt even worse. You know what I mean. Each minute away from you felt like an eternity. I love you so much.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}You are my life, my heart, and my soul. When I am near you, I feel weak, intoxicated, and mesmerized by your wonder. I feel as though time has stopped around us, as though nothing exists but you and me--not the sun, the stars, or the moon--nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^help wonder~}I'm wondering how it came to this. I can't help but think about all the good times we once had together.

<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^believe~}I don't believe our relationship can survive another break up. It seems that we constantly go back and forth, and so many suggestions and promises stay lingering over our heads.<|endoftext|>

Your beauty is so captivating! Your personality is so charismatic! It's not possible for me to stop thinking about you for very long; you are always on my mind. You do something so wonderful to me, something so indescribable that there are no words that can really express how much I love you. You have truly made me the happiest man on earth. I have never been happier in all my life. I have no clue as to what I did to be so fortunate, and I will be eternally grateful for you and the love you give to me.

I also know that even when we are arguing or mad at each other, we still love each other. If they could ever hear us argue, some people would say that we are not going to make it because, well, we can get harsh, but they do not know us. Baby, nobody knows what I have had to do to get where I am. Nobody knows what you had to do to get where you are. Nobody knows us, except for us. Baby, nobody knows about the things in my past that I had to overcome to trust you. Nobody knows what you had to overcome. Nobody knows about how scared I was of you because of what one person did to me. So many people think that I am crazy for falling in love with you, but how can they judge someone that they do not know?<|endoftext|>

There is so much more to you than that. I have liked you for a very long time now, but just never had the courage to say it to you. Well, that has all changed now, and I am going to say it. I really care a lot about you, and I would like to be a lot more than just friends. You mean so much to me. I mean, just that special smile when I'm having a bad day just brightens the day and makes it bearable. Or just to have you give me a hug comforts me.

I should be afraid to separate myself far from you....I would be martyr'd for my Religion — Love is my religion — I could die for that – I could die for you.

I love you far, far beyond my control and I always will, because what we share is more beautiful than the colors of any rainbow and they will never fade in days or only appear in rain. I love the feeling of happy tears rolling down my face. I love the taste of you when I kiss you, because it's an everyday sweetness, it's meek and it's willing. You've made my ending a new beginning. There are no other words in the dictionary to describe the very scary commentary that I am sharing. I will love you, Baby, throughout this life and beyond.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`thinkingofyou~^~}Anyway, I just felt like letting you know that I am thinking of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`thinkingofyou~^sneak slightly~}I was sleeping, yet my hand was searching for you, but you were not next to me. I turned my head and opened my eyes slightly to see you playing with your new computer, and I just smiled. As time went by, that would be so typical of me to do. I didn't know that you saw me sneaking glimpses of you. I turned my head to the other side and fell right back to sleep. Within minutes, I felt you beside me, only the terry cotton of your robe between us. I cuddled right up to you, like a puppy against his mother. I still wake up at times thinking of our first morning together when I smiled and you saw me and read my mind.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`missing~^life world~}I love you more than I can say. You are the most important thing in the world to me, and I would do anything for you. You make my life complete and I am only happy when we are together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^head the-only-person~}I never thought I could really love someone as much as I love you. We started out as friends, just talking, but over the last couple of months I've truly fallen for you, head over heels. You're not one who can admit how you feel, but I believe somewhere in your heart you have feelings for me, too. I know you would not have just wasted your time for nothing. You know I care. You're the only person who could ever put joy in my heart and a smile on my face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}My love has made me selfish. I cannot exist without you — I am forgetful of every thing but seeing you again — my Life seems to stop there — I see no further. You have absorb'd me. I have a sensation at the present moment as though I was dissolving — I should be exquisitely miserable without the hope of soon seeing you. I should be afraid to separate myself far from you....I would be martyr'd for my Religion — Love is my religion — I could die for that – I could die for you. My Creed is Love and you are it's only tenet — You have ravish'd me away by a Power I cannot resist.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^think~}I really appreciate how you are always there for me, no matter what. I don't know what I would have done this week without your love and support. You are the most loving, caring, compassionate, most awesome guy I ever met. One other guy held a special place in my heart for awhile, but you have gone way above and beyond my feelings for him. I didn't think that was possible, but I never wanted to marry him like I do you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`confession~^true~}We have been friends for a long time now. Every day spent with you is like a wonderland of surprises. I've stood back, watched and listened as you told me of your past loves. If you only knew that there is a true love waiting for you--patiently. A hug from you makes me feel brand new. But these are words I'll never say, and so I will just sit back, patiently waiting; loving you in silence.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^love want~}I want to tell you so many things. I want to share my feelings with you. I want to open my heart up. I haven't mustered enough courage to tell you what I feel for you. What I want to say is I've loved you since Day One. Since we said "hello," I knew deep inside me, you'll be a part of me. I've loved everything about you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^way love obviously~}I'm just going to have to leave you. I don't want to do it, but I want things the way they used to be, and it looks like that won't happen. I love you but your love obviously isn't as strong as you say it is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^my-heart~}It has been about a year and a half since seeing, hearing, and feeling you next to me. I hope you know that you are still all that is important in my life. Though you made the decision to stop acknowledging my existence in your life, I can never escape the pain and sorrow of the void you have left in my heart and soul. With each passing day, every time I remember to breathe, I die a little more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^~}I swear I won't do anything that will hurt you again. I want you to know that I never have cheated on you. You are everything to me. Give me a chance to show you that my love for you is real. I will love you forever.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^misery think~}And then I met you, a new friend. No sooner did we meet than I found out you had suffered the same anguish as I had just a month ago. I found it comforting to talk to you about the pain and misery of losing a love I thought would last. Somehow we never felt embarrassed talking to each other about our heartaches. It seemed to bring each of us some relief.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^believe~}I promise you this, from this day forth: I will love you forever, and don't ever doubt that. I will never want anyone else's touch but yours. You make me feel like I am the only woman in the world. You are the only man in the world as far as I am concerned! You are my heart and my soul. I feel as though we were meant to be together, that God has brought us together. I have always believed that I had a soul mate out there and I am sure that is you.

I want to thank you for being my friend. You mean everything to me. I want to tell you I love you, and I want to make you happy always.

<|startoftext|>~`missing~^my-love these-miles~}I am just writing you to let you know how much I love you. We have many miles separating us, but I know we'll make it through. You mean the world to me, and no one can ever compare to you. I think about you all the time, and wake up thinking of you and go to sleep thinking of you. Your name repeats over and over in my mind. Your very name, Matthew, means "gift of the Lord," as you have actually been to me. Each day my love grows stronger, so I know my love for you will never fade. These miles between us won't fade either, but I know that our love will keep us together. It's so odd for us to be so far away from each other, but yet so close in spirit.

<|startoftext|>~`love~^cut feelings talking~}Getting to know you has been so wonderful! So many new feelings have been introduced into my life. I remember distinctly the first time we met, when our eyes found each other through a room crowded with talking and movement. Neither you nor I could handle that moment with anything but a smile, but that connection cut through the thickness and commotion of the atmosphere like a ray of light through a dense forest canopy, a ray of light through a mass of ever-rotating clouds. How crazy it may sound that I can't think anymore or act anymore without thinking of you. You are always with me. Know that I will always be with you. I love you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`missing~^~}I have read all about you and your zodiac sign and it is a good one. You are perfect for me. You excite me so much. I look forward to each day, so that I can come there and spend time with you. Last night I dreamed of you--I could picture you with me and it was so vivid. I hope I will always be yours. I am truly lucky to have found such a dear, sweet, loving person as you, an Aquarian, not just a woman, but a beautiful, sensual woman who arouses thoughts of such unbridled passion in me, and the desire to give myself to you completely. I remain yours forever. Time will pass and I know we will stay together.<|endoftext|>

No matter what happens, you are in my heart. I hope I'll be able to hold you in my arms and tell you that I love you. That's all I need from you. I love you--that's my promise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^life~}My mistake was letting you go. I do so because I believed that needed something more than what I already had.

Then you say that if I would find someone who makes me happy, you wouldn't want to hold me back from that. Don't you understand how happy I am with you? When you say things like that, it just confuses me. I'm not sure how you differentiate between a relationship and a friendship, but I am going to tell you how I separate the two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^window~}Hopefully you are thinking about me now, like I am thinking about you. To tell you the truth, last night I cried myself to sleep, wondering what went wrong. Just three days ago, I was so happy to be with you, I could not believe that for three years we were together, happy and full of love. All of a sudden here I am alone on this rainy day, wondering what you are doing. It is okay, rainy days will come and go, but my love for you will never leave my heart. One day you will realize that I was the only one who loved you truly from the heart, and not for material things. Remember, whenever you see the raindrops on your window pane--those are my tears showing my love for you.<|endoftext|>

You're the only one who holds the key to my heart. You always say what I need to hear. Love is just what you mean to me, and you mean everything. I doubt if either one of us thought we could have met someone on the Internet and fall in love the way we did, but it happened, and I have no regrets. In fact, it is the best thing that ever happened to me, and I am very grateful. Words could not express how much joy you have brought me.<|endoftext|>

You're the only one who holds the key to my heart. You always say what I need to hear. Love is just what you mean to me, and you mean everything. I doubt if either one of us thought we could have met someone on the Internet and fall in love the way we did, but it happened, and I have no regrets. In fact, it is the best thing that ever happened to me, and I am very grateful. Words could not express how much joy you have brought me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`missing~^woman just-a-woman~}I have read all about you and your zodiac sign and it is a good one. You are perfect for me. You excite me so much. I look forward to each day, so that I can come there and spend time with you. Last night I dreamed of you--I could picture you with me and it was so vivid. I hope I will always be yours. I am truly lucky to have found such a dear, sweet, loving person as you, an Aquarian, not just a woman, but a beautiful, sensual woman who arouses thoughts of such unbridled passion in me, and the desire to give myself to you completely. I remain yours forever. Time will pass and I know we will stay together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^only-one~}In this world of uncertainties, only one thing is certain beyond a doubt: you are all I need and all I want. You are the air moving through my lungs.

<|startoftext|>~`confession~^beach some-day the-smile~}Thanks for the smile you gave me. I really melted inside. I could say nothing, but just stared at your natural beauty. I wish we could go out together some day, and that we could have our nights by the beach. I would pour my feelings out to you then. Thank you for the feelings you awaken. No matter what happens, you are in my heart. I hope I'll be able to hold you in my arms and tell you that I love you. That's all I need from you. I love you--that's my promise.<|endoftext|>

When you say things like that, it just confuses me. I'm not sure how you differentiate between a relationship and a friendship, but I am going to tell you how I separate the two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^changes experience~}My mistake was letting you go. I do so because I believed that needed something more than what I already had.

<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}Hopefully you are thinking about me now, like I am thinking about you. To tell you the truth, last night I cried myself to sleep, wondering what went wrong. Just three days ago, I was so happy to be with you, I could not believe that for three years we were together, happy and full of love. All of a sudden here I am alone on this rainy day, wondering what you are doing. It is okay, rainy days will come and go, but my love for you will never leave my heart. One day you will realize that I was the only one who loved you truly from the heart, and not for material things.

During the moments I tried to turn away for fear of the unknown, you dug your heels into the ground and looked deep into my soul and stayed. You compromised your life and your goals to help me survive, and I owe much to you. Without you I could not even go on.<|endoftext|>

I've spent the time since then kicking myself for the things that I did, and for the things that I didn't do. All I can do now is say I love you, I love you, I love you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^~}You walked into my life a stranger a mere eight months ago, and my life hasn't been the same since. You are TRULY my gift from a higher power. "Love" is such a small word for what we share. You are amazing. You came into my life when I was at a low point: a time when I thought that the pain brought on by someone else would never end. During the moments I tried to turn away for fear of the unknown, you dug your heels into the ground and looked deep into my soul and stayed. You compromised your life and your goals to help me survive, and I owe much to you. Without you I could not even go on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}It's so much of an understatement to say I'm glad that you are mine! Since we've been together, an appreciation for the possibilities and joys of living have arisen in me, and I can never really thank you enough for that. You have refreshed my most precious possession--my heart. Through your love, you have opened my eyes to the wonders all around me. I can't truly thank you enough for this gift, but please know that I will never give you a reason to say that I don't care about you. There is not a second that you're not in my mind. I will always be there for you, and I will always love you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}I turn and lay my head against the pillow, feeling your heartbeat drum a lullaby in my ear.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^~}Let me explain a little what I want in my life. I want someone to share my laughter and my fears. Someone to listen and to be there when I feel like the world is crashing down on me, and I want to give that same courtesy back to them in return. I don't need someone standing at my door waiting for me to get home, or to be around constantly, because that makes me a little jittery. I do think that since you and I have spent so much in-depth time together, I have become a little dependent on you being there and wanting to talk to you. That doesn't necessarily mean seeing you every day, or talking to you in a three-hour phone call, just the reassurance of knowing that you are still there. "Hi, how are you. How was your day"...just stuff like that. Is that too much for you? It sometimes feels like you only call when you know I am upset. It seems like you hardly ever call just because you want to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^~}I need us to hold hands and laugh together, love together, and also to cry together. My life is joined with yours, my love. Not just for the present, but for the past and for the future. Especially for the future. We are separated by so much distance but my love, you live in my heart. You are never far. All I have to do is think of you and you are here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`missing~^hurts~}Being far away from you is difficult. Not sharing every day with you and not being able to hold you whenever I want hurts so much, but I know that at the end of all this pain, I will find you again.

<|startoftext|>~`love~^that-first-date~}Before we went out on that first date, I had doubts that you would be everything you portrayed yourself to be. I didn't think it was possible to find someone so perfect for me in so many ways. You have shown me that love can be true, pure, and genuine. I knew from the beginning that you were special and that it was only a matter of time before I fell helplessly in love with you. You make me so happy and fulfill me so completely. I thank God each and every day for bringing you into my life. When I look into your eyes, I see a future of endless possibilities and everlasting love. You are my forever.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}The first time I heard you say the words, "I love you," it was like I had been taken to Cloud 9, and I haven't come down until now. Right after you uttered those words, I asked myself, "Do I love him?" As I looked for an answer, I asked again: "Have he given me any reason not to?" No, just more reasons to love you.

I hope somehow that I made your life special, anyway, though I've not been perfect for you. I hope you'll be happy now and that you can find the person whom you truly deserve.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`confession~^my-burning-feelings express~}This letter is my heart-template in which my burning feelings for you will finally be expressed. If you can remember, I sat by your side at the Public Library, only two days ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^your-kindness~}I love you just for being you, for your humor, and for your kindness. You are the only person who has ever made me feel this way, and my heart is yours forever.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`confession~^exist the-very-moment girl~}I was sent down to earth on a mission, a mission to find someone that would complete me. I never thought that my task would be fulfilled till the very moment that I met you. That's when I finally found the perfection that I had been seeking all my life. At that very moment, I didn't believe my eyes as the girl that I had thought only existed in a fairytale was now standing in front of me. Each night, as I stood staring at the moon, I saw your gentle smile, the smile that gave me the strength to make the impossible possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^size whom~}How thankful I am that it was you, my love, with whom I shared so many cherished moments. "Thank you" seems so small in comparison to the size of the world you've shown me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^need~}I know I have been very stupid. I know I am not perfect. I also know that I love you. I know I made a mistake. You once told me that we can face any challenge together. All we need is to love each other and we will come out all right. Our dreams will come true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^love~}I love you so very much, and I hope this reassures you, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^love~}It has been a long time since we first met. I can't believe how long I've loved you, and how long I have contained my love.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^pray come night~}I pray every night for you to come back. Every time I think of you, I decide: "Okay, think of the last happy memory when you were together; then move on." I never can.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^world a-life~}I am trying to be patient for us to be together again, and you know I'm probably the most impatient person in the world. I don't care how long it takes for us to work this out because I am so sure of the outcome. For me the outcome is a life of happiness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^~}It's amazing how you got me and won me. I never thought I could love this much, but I was so wrong. I just thank God for having found you. We were meant for each other, and no one can change that. I love you with ALL my heart.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`thinkingofyou~^day~}I know we don't get to talk or to see each other much anymore. But being apart from you for awhile doesn't change the way I feel about you. Sure, I'm lonely, and sometimes I'm overwhelmed. But, just remember that I love you and everything about you. That's what gets me through every long day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^~}Even if it will take me a lifetime, I will wait for you to come back. I would not want another love. I'd rather be alone than be with someone who could never take your place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`missing~^~}I really wish that you were near me, and when I need help, you could appear and help me. I want to do the same for you, too, but knowing that you love me is enough and, if I can be your wife and your children's mom, then this would make me proud for the rest of my life. Remember, you need to take care of all of us, so you've got to take good care of yourself too. Ti Amo tesoro mio, you're the only one that I want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^the-freedom~}I need not explain how we met, because you walked the exact same way toward me as I walked to find you. I need not tell you how much I love you, because we speak the same language. I need not explain to you the depths of our love, because you have sat with me in the center of its depths. I need not tell you about the freedom of what we say, because we are not chained by words. I need not tell you about the tenderness of touch, because we have both held each other's hands and felt butterflies in our hearts. I need not tell you about the magic of a whisper, because we have listened with our souls. No one needed to explain to us what darkness felt like, because we were lost in it before. No one needed to teach us how it felt to step into the light, because we both had to shut our eyes when the bright light of love surrounded us. I need not tell you about the power of peace, because we've been lovers in each other's worlds of sand, where colors speak with words. I need not tell you about the importance of a single second now, either, because we have tasted the sweetness of a heavenly moment and the bitterness of when it's not long enough. I need not tell you how hearts can break and how they are mended, because we mended each other's broken hearts when we first met.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^~}It's amazing how you got me and won me. I never thought I could love this much, but I was so wrong. I just thank God for having found you. We were meant for each other, and no one can change that. I love you with ALL my heart.<|endoftext|>

I pray that you never do anything to make me regret this. Yes, now I can honestly say that I love you and will always love you because we seem to be soul mates.

We couldn't resist one another in those days or the need to follow our desire to its climax.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}The past three years together have been so wonderful, so unforgettable, and so amazingly fulfilling. I cannot begin to tell you the way you have changed my life.

<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^bad love~}If only I could find the courage to give you this letter. I never knew love until I knew you. We shared our minds, bodies, hearts, and souls with each other. We shared a feeling so deep that it simply couldn't be put into words, but I never knew loving someone could hurt this bad. We have hurt each other in ways we promised we never would, too.<|endoftext|>

I simply love you and think of you all the time. Whether moving through chores at home, working at the office, eating a meal, or just walking around--no matter what, you are always with me. No matter what I am doing, I think of the strength of our love, the way we hold each other, and the way you whisper in my ear. I know, from the bottom of my heart, that we are meant to be together forever. I love you so very much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^shoulder inspiration~}Things could not be any better than they are now, with you in my life. You are my inspiration and you're the one who stands by me through everything and gives me a shoulder to cry on. Most of all, you make me know that I am loved. There is no one that makes me feel whole the way that you do. You mean everything to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^hard endure love~}I may be able to fool others, but I cannot fool myself. I would be a great liar if I said that I'm not in love with you. No matter what you think or say, all I can say is, I really love you with all my heart. If you will give me just a little time to prove my feelings to you and that I deserve your feelings, I will work hard at winning you. I can barely endure the extreme anxiety and the sleepless nights I have experienced lately.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^eternity life~}Our belated anniversary comes with my humble commitment to serve you for life. To give you the joy of a relationship that lets you be yourself, because I know and identify with the human being in you. Sure, I don't claim to understand everything that you care about, but I will always strive to listen with my heart and reach out for the emotionally complex being in you, to understand how best my life can serve yours and support you, fulfilling the purpose for which your life is meant. On this year's anniversary and beyond, it is with my life and with the life that we hope to create together that I say I love you. By seeking your hand to build a family and to pass on the gift of life to our children, I am saying I love you, not only in this life and beyond, but for all eternity. I wish you a blissful anniversary and many more to a selfless lady with so much integrity and grace, worthy of the true gift of love. I love you, and I always will.<|endoftext|>

We, going our separate ways, might work out for the better but it is still an unknown thought. I can't say what is best for you. I can only say what is best for the boys, you and me as a couple and all of us as a family. If we weather this together there is nothing that can ever break us apart. We will be so far down the road, more mature, more secure and more in love than ever before.<|endoftext|>

Ever since you first entered my life, I felt as if God sent one of his angels down to me, and this is no joke.

A lot of time has passed, and just because I feel as though I am ready to have you in my life again, it may now be different for you. I know I can't have things fall into place whenever I am ready for them; destiny has no patience and holds back for no one.

<|startoftext|>~`missing~^our-love depths any-thought~}Our love has been assaulted many times, and I am convinced that it is true love because the longer I am away from you, the greater my yearning is to be with you again. I cherish any thought of you, prize any memory of you that rises from the depths of my mind, and live for the day when our physical separation will no longer exist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^justified negative~}Thank you for acknowledging my thoughts and feelings, whether they are positive or negative, justified or unjustified. I feel safe being myself, knowing I cannot be perfect, but that you will continue to love me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`love~^want one soul~}You make me feel loved; you make me feel safe. Even more importantly, you make me feel wanted--something I hadn't felt in a long time. From the first day we met, I think we both knew our friendship would grow. Neither one of us could imagine the love we would both feel now--not exploding in our hearts from the beginning, but just slowly growing into a beautiful relationship that only you and I could understand. We are seldom apart now. You are my soul mate, my best friend, my inspiration, my love.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`confession~^girlfriend feel boyfriend~}I love you so much, and my wish finally came true last Saturday, when you first said that you loved me. My heart lifted because it felt so good inside to finally hear the words I had been longing to hear. We had been friends longer than we had been boyfriend and girlfriend. I'm so in love with you now. I promise you this: I will never lie or do anything to hurt you. You make me feel good inside and so happy, too. It's amazing being with you because you're such an amazing person. I don't know what the future holds--that's something only heaven knows. I just know that love you, and I know that I always will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`confession~^a-light live no-trouble~}When I met you, as if by a God-sent blessing, I thought that I saw a light of soft understanding. What had come over me?

<|startoftext|>~`missing~^the-thoughts forever~}It has been almost four months since I met that person online that truly took my heart away, but now it seems that it was more than that. Time flies faster and gets deeper and greater. We've continued communicating and fixed a regular chatting schedule once a week just to share each other's thoughts and dreams. We even manage to send e-mails and off-line messages. Once we've gotten a chance, we love to call each other whenever possible and that makes the relationship stronger, giving me the thoughts that it will definitely last forever, even if sometimes I think that distance would be of great hindrance and destroy us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`lostlove~^time~}If you really decide to let go, then there's nothing I can do. I know "sorry' is not enough for the things I have done, but I hope my sincerity is enough. I regret the foolish things that I have done. Because of those things, I lost you, I lost my life. And I'll never love again because of that. But if you can give me another chance, I swear this time I'll make sure I won't hurt you and never, ever let you go.<|endoftext|>

There will be no looking back, no second thoughts, and no regrets. I love you and only you, and my love grows stronger every day. We know that life can hit us with events that take us totally by surprise. I want you to know that your capacity for love, caring, and understanding has taken me by surprise, and it still never ceases to amaze me! I've truly been blessed to find you, and now I will never let you go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^love~}You may think I don't love you anymore. However, from this day on, I'm going to try harder to become a better person and not to be so stubborn about everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}I just want to tell you how very much I love you, now and forever. You light up my life forever, Sweetheart. I thank God each and every day for our love for each other. I am so very thankful that God blessed me with a husband as wonderful as you are. I am looking forward to next September when we renew our wedding vows to one another. You have always been there for me no matter what the situation was. I love spending my life with you. All your passionate kisses and hugs mean everything to me and always will. Our love will always grow because we love one another so much. You mean everything to me and always will--now and forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}Our lives together began with my pursuit of a man who was mysterious and respectable. I didn't stop until I had him to myself. He has shown me what exciting and enriching things I am capable of. He greets me with a smile and a kiss every morning. You're my love, life, heartache, and strife. You will always be my happiness. I am so happy I am your love. You are mine--eternally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^soul some-sort~}Sometimes I feel it's only me who has the true love, and yours is some sort of fantasy love. I have put my heart and soul into the past nine months of my life with you. I feel all the effort I have put in this has got to get me somewhere! Then there are days that I just want to let go and say "enough is enough" again. But it's easy to propose impossible solutions!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~`secondchance~^words~}I feel in my heart and in my soul each little thing you say to me. I believe you always know when I am sad, when I am happy, or when I think of you more than I usually do. Your words show me how much you understand me, how much you love me, and how much we are connected to each other. Even with the distance between us, I realize more and more that we were meant for each other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^today real your-lips~}You are my dream come true, my soul mate, my angel sent from above. I never thought it was possible to love someone the way I love you, but that was before I met you. We met differently than other couples--we met online. I didn't get to hold you, feel you, caress your silky skin, touch your lips, but I carried you with me all day long in my heart. My love for you grows more and more with every day that goes by. You know that I love you more than anything; that's why I don't understand why you ask me if I love you, or how do I love you? You don't need to have doubts because my love for you is real and always will be. If I stay quiet and don't say anything when you ask me that, it's not because I don't want to answer or don't know what to say, it's because there isn't anything that can describe my love for you. There isn't anything as amazing as you are, Honey. I will love you today, tomorrow, and FOREVER!<|endoftext|>

A lesson of life to be lived with a memory of how not to behave. You and I have reopened the door of conversation. I want to know the man you truly are. We can never hide from each other again. This journey I ask you to walk with me will be joyous at times and rough at other times. I don't offer you perfection. I offer you me, a woman who has weaknesses.

I am a man who thinks his wife is the most beautiful, sexy and desirable women and a man who wants no other women other than his wife. I am the father of her children, a man who conceived his children with love with their mother and wants to raise them with the love and by the side of their mother. I am a father who wants to teach his sons what he has learned about respect, love, honor and above all else appreciation of and for a women that they will love. I am a father whose wife and children are the most important things in his life and will never do anything to jeopardize that. What this man wants is a family that enjoys doing things together, finds joy with each other and learns from each other. I am a man who wants a wife who feels the same way and looks at me adoringly and who I can arouse the same passion for me in her as she does for me. I am a man who wants to work hand in hand and heart to heart with his wife to have a future where each day is better than the day before. I am a man who wants to know his wife's interests, fears, passions, wants needs and desires so I may help her realize them or support her in her pursuit of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`sorry~^hurt need~}I am very sorry for hurting you last night. You caused me pain too and I'm really confused about everything. I very much want things to be stable. I want you to get all the time you need to decide what you want to do. I love you, so please never think that I can forget you. Hope to hear from you soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~`love~^~}We met almost four years ago, and my life hasn't been the same since. You began as my friend, someone I could talk to, laugh with, someone who was always there for me, even when there were gaps because one of us had left for a while. Somewhere in the past 2 ' years, though, I fell in love with you and, ever since then, I've always been waiting here for you, but waiting for you to realize I am here, and that all you have to do is ask, and I'd be there with you. Instead, I sit back and watch you become unhappy because you are alone, all because the one you love now can't--or won't do--something to make you happy.<|endoftext|>
